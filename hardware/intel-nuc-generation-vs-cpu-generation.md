# Intel NUC Generation vs CPU Generation

## NUC Naming Schema
  - ## Up to Gen 10
    - Schema: `NUC` + `[NUC_GEN]` + `[CPU_GEN]` + `[NUC_FAMILY_CODE]` + `[FORM_FACTOR_CODE]`
      - Reference: [Product Code Naming Convention for Intel® NUC (Up to Gen 10)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000031273/intel-nuc.html)
      - Example: `NUC5i7RYH`
  - ## Gen 11+
    - Schema: `NUC` + `[NUC_GEN]` + `[NUC_FAMILY_CODE]` + `[FORM_FACTOR_CODE]` + `[CPU_GEN]`
      - Example: `NUC12WSHi5`
      - Reference: [Product Code Naming Convention for Intel® NUC (Gen 11+)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000060119/intel-nuc.html)
