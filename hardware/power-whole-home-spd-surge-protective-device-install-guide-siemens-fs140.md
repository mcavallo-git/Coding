# Installing a Whole-Home Surge Protective Device (SPD)

<!-- ------------------------------ -->

***

### Required Hardware <sup>`~ $350 (net)`</sup>
1. #### Surge Protective Device <sup>`~ $250`</sup>
    - `Siemens` `FS140` *(FirstSurge Pro `140 kA` Surge Protective Device)*
      - [View Product (Amazon)](https://amazon.com/dp/B013WINMK6)

1. #### Spare Breaker <sup>`~ $25`</sup>
    - [`Two-Pole`, `20A` or `30A` Breaker](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YSMYK)
      - > Recommended breaker size is `20A`. *<sup>[(Citation)](https://cache.industry.siemens.com/dl/files/623/109793623/att_1054703/v1/SIE_CS_FS60_FS100_FS140.pdf)</sup>*

    - [`3/4"` Liquid-Tight Non-Metallic Conduit Adapters](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3RYM3B)
      - > Note: The `FS140` has a built-in `3/4"` conduit adapter (located where the wires leave its chassis)
1. #### Mounting Screws <sup>`~ $25`</sup>
   - [`3/16"` "Tapcon" Concrete Screw Anchors for Masonry](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B071LG9GYV)
      - > The hole diameter for the FirsSurge mounting feet is `0.2"` ~ `#12` screw would be suitable to fasten the SPD to the wall.

## Installation Steps

1. Turn off the main breaker within the breaker box (for safety, if possible)

1. Determine intended mount location for `FS140`
    - > *This determines the length of conduit needed to cover all wires running between the `FS140`'s mount location and its associated knock-out panel on the breaker box*
    - > *Ensure that the mount location allows the `FS140`'s wires, when ran through conduit through a knock-out panel on the breaker box, will have ample length to reach the `ground bar` (green `FS140` wire), `neutral bar` (white `FS140` wire) & spare `two-pole 20A or 30A breaker` (both black `FS140` wires).*

1. Pass the `FS140`'s wires through a `3/4"` conduit adapter & screw the adapter into the `FS140`

1. Knock out a breaker box knock-out panel (which the `FS140`'s wires will run through)

1. Cut a length of `3/4"` conduit which will be used to cover the `FS140`'s wires between the mount location and the breaker box knock-out panel

1. Pass the `FS140`'s wires through the cut length of conduit & attach the length of conduit to the `FS140`'s conduit adapter once all wires are passed through

1. Pass the `FS140`'s wires through a reversed, separate conduit adapter, and attach it to the unterminated end of the length of conduit

1. Pass the `FS140`'s wires through the knock-out panel on the breaker box, then attach the second conduit adapter to said knock-out panel on the breaker box

1. Wire the `FS140`'s `green wire` to the `ground bar` in the breaker box

1. Wire the `FS140`'s `white wire` to the `neutral bar` in the breaker box

1. Wire the `FS140`'s `black wires` to a spare `two-pole 20A or 30A breaker` in the breaker box

1. Drill pilot holes into cinderblocks, making sure to hit cinderblock studs (middle `1"`, left `1"` or right `1"` of each cinderblock)
    - > *If the drill quickly pushes through while drilling into the cinderblock then (similar to drywall) you know you've missed the stud & need to drill a new pilot hole*

1. Mount `FS140` onto cinderblocks using tapcon anchors drilled into cinderblock pilot holes
