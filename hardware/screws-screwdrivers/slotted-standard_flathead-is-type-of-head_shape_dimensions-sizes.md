# Screw/Screwdriver Dimensions, Sizes

- ## `Slotted` (aka `Standard`) Screws & Drive Tools

  - ### Word of Warning
    - ⚠️ The term `flat-head` has nothing to do with the drive type of a screw
      - `Slotted` (or `standard`) is the correct term to use when describing screws whose drive type is a simple line across the diameter of the screw head
      - `Flat-head screws` actually refer to a specific screw-head geometry
        - Specifically, `flat-head screws` are ones which mate flushly with the surface they're being screwed into (and does not therefore specify anything about the drive type required for said screw)
      - Therefore, when attempting to reference a `slotted` or `standard` screw or driver (but *especially* when discussing screws), it is best to avoid usage of the term `flat-head` as a descriptor of the drive type, and to opt for using `slotted` or `standard`, instead

      > The width of the tip and the length of the shank are presented in the measurements provided... as width by length (for example, 1/8" x 4").
      > &nbsp;
      > Unfortunately, the way slotted screwdrivers are measured can be frustrating, as the thickness of the tip is rarely given.
      > &nbsp;
      > The length of the handle is proportionate to the length of the shank, so short-shanked drives also have short handles.
