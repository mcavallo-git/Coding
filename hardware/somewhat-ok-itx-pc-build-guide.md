# Somewhat OK Mini ITX PC Build Guide
  - *Note: The word "float" in this guide refers to the action of holding something heavy **just** above something else, in an attempt to gauge distances, line things up, etc.*


<br /><hr /><br />

## 0 - Tools
- Prep your tools in one, known location and keep putting em back in that same spot (pure preference, there). Get the cardboard box out of your case and get the screw baggies out of it and familiarize yourself with ish-what is in there


<br /><hr /><br />

## 1 - Case
- Take both sides & top off your case. Lean them gently against a nearby wall (generally out-of-the-way).


<br /><hr /><br />

## 2.0 - Mobo
- Take mobo out of its magnetic shielding bag, place that bag flat back where it came out of, and place the motherboard back ontop of it as a static-free workbench.

  ## 2.1 - I/O Shield
  - Take the long rectangular I/O Shield (which matches your motherboard to your case) and attach it to your case by placing it inside where the motherboard will go, then moving it towards the back of the case (you'll see the slot on the case) - make sure up-is-up (orientation-wise), verify this respective to CPU slot on mobo, looking back and forth from case to motherboard to double-check


<br /><hr /><br />

## 3 - CPU
- Take out CPU, do not bend pins (be gentle), and line up the colored/notched corner (look for a triangle/etc.) for which way it should be oriented. Lift the CPU locking-lever to release it (metal, shiny, paperclip-looking latch/lever which is usually at the bottom of the CPU socket, running just-longer than the length of the socket itself). If there is a plastic blocker/placeholder in the CPU slot, remove it. Gently lay CPU into the Mobo's CPU socket, making sure to line up the notched/marked corners as you install it. Once CPU is fully in the socket, slowly lower/close the CPU locking-lever - It may need to go away-from-then-back-towards the socket to lock into place --> Force-wise, you should only have to apply as much force as resting your hand on the lever would be worth (e.g. not much force needed).


<br /><hr /><br />

## 4.0 - CPU Cooler - Prep
- The CPU cooler will come with Thermal Grease on the bottom of it (where it meets the CPU) - make sure this is there (gray square on the bottom of cpu cooler) and make sure to take any plastic cover off of it ONLY when ready to place it on the CPU and motherboard. Leave the plastic on til then. Messy greasy stuff that you want 100% of to be in the picture when you put the cooler on.

  ## 4.1 - CPU Cooler - Install
  - Wraith RGB Fan should be pre-compatible with your existing case's black plastic mounts (around the CPU slot). Keep plastic on, line-up screwholes, decide orientation desired, and once verified, take plastic off and place directly downwards towards CPU with screwholes aligned. Screw in opposite corners lightly, first, then other corners lightly, then tighten first 2, then tighten last 2 - Ryzen's CPU Cooler screws will hit a definite stopping point - once all 4 hit it, locate the 4-Pin power plug coming off of it and plug it into your CPU FAN port on motherboard (see https://imgur.com/2272GL0 )


<br /><hr /><br />

## 5 - RAM
- Unlock RAM slot (little click-latch/lever at top of slot), line up RAM with slot (one set of pins is longer) - slide RAM stick downwards with both top & bottom at the same rate --> don't go all angled on it (e.g. dont let one side get way further down before the other side, both should hit the port at about the same time, or it may not fit properly). Keep pushing until you force the RAM lock (lever/latch) to click closed just by you pushing the RAM stick into the slot. Do not manually click the RAM lock closed. RAM lock should close by you pushing the RAM directly towards the motherboard (3-5x as much pressure as CPU lock in previous step).


<br /><hr /><br />

## 6 - I/O Shield
- Donâ€™t skip putting the I/O Shield into your case. I've ran into situations where I'm cleaning up and find the I/O shield and I'm just like "We've gone too far" - We're not too far, yet! Get the I/O Shield on if it isn't yet! 


<br /><hr /><br />

## 7 - Mobo - Prep
- Before screwing mobo into case, make sure standoff screws (hexagon-shaped, female one end, male the other-end) are installed for the screw-holes you need to use for your motherboard. Determine which screw-holes you'll need to use by grabbing the motherboard and lifting it by its newly attached CPU cooler (which should now be tightened down all the way and very secure) - eyeball which holes you need to use by floating it gently into place - I've use a fine-point pen/sharpie to mark the screw-holes on the case through the screw-holes on the motherboard before (for larger boards). Once you mark/know which ones youll need, place the mobo back in its box, screw down the desired standoffs (as-needed), then rock the motherboard into place by placing the lower-corner of the side meeting with the I/O Shield down-first 


<br /><hr /><br />

## 8 - Mobo - Install
- Unlike the RAM, this WILL be a rocking / one-side-down-then-the-other approach. Grab the motherboard by the CPU cooler once again, float it into place, then match it up with the I/O shield by looking from the back/outside of the case-in. once it's lined up, screw in the top-leftmost screw half-way on your motherboard (top of I/O shield) into respective standoff. Screw in farthest screw next (bottom-right) half-way. Fill-in the rest of the screws full-tighten. Double-back and tighten the first two screws as well as all screws as a double-check.


<br /><hr /><br />

## 9.0 - GPU - Prep
- Determine your target PCIEx16 slot to place GPU into (recommended topmost PCIEx16 slot - for ITX builds usually only have one slot to choose from). Unscrew PCIE brackets on case which align with the slot by floating the GPU over said slot, then eyeballing which brackets will need to be removed from chassis. Place GPU aside, remove brackets from case. Unlock PCIE slot on the right-side by pushing the right-most side of the lever towards the motherboard. it should tily 'away' from the PCIE slot, somewhat-similar to the RAM-stick locking mechanism.

  ## 9.1 - GPU - Install
  - Similar to RAM, not a rocking motion for this install, but rather it should be straight down-and-in. Float GPU into place - Two things to line up here: 1-[ make sure the copper pins on the bottom of the GPU are aligned with PCIEx16 slot before pushing it down ], 2-[ make sure the metal PCIE brackets which go towards the outside of the case are going down and into your motherboard tray correctly (as these can block the left side of the GPU from going down and in) ]. Once things are lined up and ready to go in, rest the GPU into PCIEx16 slot and push it towards the motherboard until all of the copper lanes on the GPU are no longer visible (they should be down far enough into the Motherboard PCIE slot to where you cant see them anymore) - make sure the PCIE-latch clicks closed, with importance being on the copper lanes being fully matched with the board. Screw in the brackets on the top-left of the GPU onto the case, bottom screw first, top screw second.


<br /><hr /><br />

## 10.0 - M.2 SSD - Prep
- Unscrew the heatsink+fan unit covering the M.2 SSD slot (screw should be at the bottom-right of the M.2 Heatsink, near the right-side of the GPU's PCIE-x16 slot). Unplug M.2 fan (if exists). Unscrew any placeholder M.2 screw.

  ## 10.1 - M.2 SSD - Install
  - This will be a rocking install (sort-of), again. M.2's have a spring mechanism which makes their far-end lift up when not screwed down, for easy maintenance/release. Place the M.2 SSD into the slot at ~a 20-30 degree angle, then take the screw which will hold it down on the opposite end, and place it into the far U-shaped slot on the disk, push down, and screw in. Peel-off any plastic from thermal pad on M.2 heatsink/fan (if exists). Plug M.2 fan back-in (if exists) and screw M.2 heatsink it back onto the motherboard.

  ## 10.2 - M.2 SSD - Side-Note
  - Don't use the M.2 slot on the back of your motherboard, just leave it blank. SSDs get hot nowadays and require adequate cooling. the back slot on motherboards never supplies this properly


<br /><hr /><br />

## 11 - PSU
- Install PSU then run cables for 24-pin (Mobo), 8-pin CPU (Mobo), 2*8-pin GPU or "VGA" (Graphics Card), and SATA (Corsair Commander Pro and Corsair Lighting Node Pro)


<br /><hr /><br />

## 12.0 - Case-to-Motherboard Connectors
- See https://imgur.com/2272GL0   (otherwise see ASUS User's Manual - Section 1.1.2 "Motherboard layout")

  ## 12.1 - Power-LED, Power-SW, Reset-SW, HDD-LED
  - Your board likely comes with an Ezpz dongle to plug these into, which you then plug as a whole-unit onto your mobo. ASUS is great at these little quality-of-life things, which help you (or at least me) to feel like you're gettin' what you paid for.

## 15 - GPU Power
- Make sure to replace the 8-pin with the 6-pin plug in the far end of the EVGA 90-degree L-Shaped cover, plug it onto your GPU, then run both 8-pin PCIE power runs from your PSU to the far-end of the EVGA L-Bend (closer to mobo)
