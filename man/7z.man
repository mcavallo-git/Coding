NAME
       7z - A file archiver with high compression ratio format

SYNOPSIS
       7z <command> [<switches>... ] <archive_name> [<file_names>... ] [<@listfiles>... ]

DESCRIPTION
       7-Zip  is  a file archiver supporting 7z (that implements LZMA compression algorithm featuring very high compression ratio), LZMA2, XZ, ZIP, Zip64,
       CAB, RAR (if the non-free p7zip-rar package is installed), ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM, ISO, most filesystem images and DEB formats.  Compres‚Äê
       sion ratio in the new 7z format is 30-50% better than ratio in ZIP format.

       7z uses plugins to handle archives, so it might be slightly slower than 7za(1) but can handle more archive formats.

COMMANDS

       b      Benchmark

       d      Delete files from archive

       e      Extract files from archive (without using directory names)

       h      Calculate hash values for files

       i      Show information about supported formats

       l      List contents of archive

DIAGNOSTICS
       7-Zip returns the following exit codes:

              0      Normal (no errors or warnings detected)

              1      Warning (Non fatal error(s)). For example, some files cannot be read during compressing, so they were not compressed

              2      Fatal error

              7      Bad command line parameters

              8      Not enough memory for operation

              255    User stopped the process with control-C (or similar)

Backup and limitations
       DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix because :
        - 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.

       On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :
        - to backup a directory  : tar cf - directory | 7z a -si directory.tar.7z
        - to restore your backup : 7z x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -

       If you want to send files and directories (not the owner of file) to others Unix/MacOS/Windows users, you can use the 7-zip format.

         example : 7z a directory.7z  directory

       Do not use "-r" because this flag does not do what you think.

       Do not use directory/* because of ".*" files (example : "directory/*" does not match "directory/.profile")

EXAMPLE 1
       7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1
              adds all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z using "ultra settings"

       -t7z   7z archive

       -m0=lzma
              lzma method

       -mx=9  level of compression = 9 (Ultra)

       -mfb=64
              number of fast bytes for LZMA = 64

       -md=32m
              dictionary size = 32 megabytes

       -ms=on solid archive = on

EXAMPLE 2
       7z a -sfx archive.exe dir1
              add all files from directory "dir1" to SFX archive archive.exe (Remark : SFX archive MUST end with ".exe")

EXAMPLE 3
       7z a -mhe=on -pmy_password archive.7z a_directory
              add all files from directory "a_directory" to the archive "archive.7z" (with data and header archive encryption on)
