NAME
       add-apt-repository - Adds a repository into the /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d or removes an existing one

SYNOPSIS
       add-apt-repository [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY

DESCRIPTION
       add-apt-repository  is  a  script  which  adds  an external APT repository to either /etc/apt/sources.list or a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or
       removes an already existing repository.

       The options supported by add-apt-repository are:

       -h, --help Show help message and exit

       -m, --massive-debug Print a lot of debug information to the command line

       -r, --remove Remove the specified repository

       -y, --yes Assume yes to all queries

       -u, --update After adding the repository, update the package cache with packages from this repository (avoids need to apt-get update)

       -k, --keyserver Use a custom keyserver URL instead of the default

       -s, --enable-source Allow downloading of the source packages from the repository

REPOSITORY STRING
       REPOSITORY can be either a line that can be added directly to sources.list(5), in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> for adding  Personal  Package  Ar‚Äê
       chives, or a distribution component to enable.

       In the first form, REPOSITORY will just be appended to /etc/apt/sources.list.

       In   the  second  form,  ppa:<user>/<ppa-name>  will  be  expanded  to  the  full  deb  line  of  the  PPA  and  added  into  a  new  file  in  the
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory.  The GPG public key of the newly added PPA will also be downloaded and added to apt's keyring.

       In the third form, the given distribution component will be enabled for all sources.
