       arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr [temp]

       arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr [netmask nm] pub

       arp [-vnD] [-H type] [-i if] -f [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Arp  manipulates  or  displays  the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache. It can add entries to the table,
       delete one or display the current content.

       ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the media access  control  address  of  a
       network neighbour for a given IPv4 Address.

MODES
       arp  with no mode specifier will print the current content of the table. It is possible to limit the number
       of entries printed, by specifying an hardware address type, interface name or host address.

       arp -d address will delete a ARP table entry. Root or netadmin privilege is required to do this. The  entry
       is  found by IP address. If a hostname is given, it will be resolved before looking up the entry in the ARP
       table.

       arp -s address hw_addr is used to set up a new table entry. The format of the hw_addr parameter  is  depen‚Äê
       dent  on  the  hardware class, but for most classes one can assume that the usual presentation can be used.
       For the Ethernet class, this is 6 bytes in hexadecimal, separated by colons. When adding proxy arp  entries
       (that  is those with the publish flag set) a netmask may be specified to proxy arp for entire subnets. This
       is not good practice, but is supported by older kernels because it can be useful. If the temp flag  is  not
       supplied  entries  will  be  permanent stored into the ARP cache. To simplify setting up entries for one of
       your own network interfaces, you can use the arp -Ds address ifname form. In that case the hardware address
       is taken from the interface with the specified name.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

       -n, --numeric
              shows numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

       -H type, --hw-type type, -t type
              When  setting  or reading the ARP cache, this optional parameter tells arp which class of entries it
              should check for.  The default value of this parameter is ether (i.e. hardware code  0x01  for  IEEE
              802.3  10Mbps  Ethernet).  Other values might include network technologies such as ARCnet (arcnet) ,
              PROnet (pronet) , AX.25 (ax25) and NET/ROM (netrom).

       -a     Use alternate BSD style output format (with no fixed columns).

       -e     Use default Linux style output format (with fixed columns).

       -D, --use-device
              Instead of a hw_addr, the given argument is the name of an interface.  arp will use the MAC  address
              of  that  interface for the table entry. This is usually the best option to set up a proxy ARP entry
              to yourself.

       -i If, --device If
              Select an interface. When dumping the ARP cache only entries matching the specified  interface  will
              be  printed.  When  setting a permanent or temp ARP entry this interface will be associated with the
              entry; if this option is not used, the kernel will guess based on the routing table. For pub entries
              the specified interface is the interface on which ARP requests will be answered.
              NOTE:  This  has to be different from the interface to which the IP datagrams will be routed.  NOTE:
              As of kernel 2.2.0 it is no longer possible to set an ARP entry for an entire subnet. Linux  instead
              does  automagic proxy arp when a route exists and it is forwarding. See arp(7) for details. Also the
              dontpub option which is available for delete and set operations cannot be used with  2.4  and  newer
              kernels.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Similar  to the -s option, only this time the address info is taken from file filename.  This can be
              used if ARP entries for a lot of hosts have to be set up.  The name of the data file is  very  often
              /etc/ethers, but this is not official. If no filename is specified /etc/ethers is used as default.

              The  format of the file is simple; it only contains ASCII text lines with a hostname, and a hardware
              address separated by whitespace. Additionally the pub, temp and netmask flags can be used.

       In all places where a hostname is expected, one can also enter an IP address in dotted-decimal notation.

       As a special case for compatibility the order of the hostname and the hardware address can be exchanged.

       Each complete entry in the ARP cache will be marked with the C flag. Permanent entries are  marked  with  M
       and published entries have the P flag.

EXAMPLES
       /usr/sbin/arp -i eth0 -Ds 10.0.0.2 eth1 pub

       This will answer ARP requests for 10.0.0.2 on eth0 with the MAC address for eth1.

       /usr/sbin/arp -i eth1 -d 10.0.0.1

       Delete  the ARP table entry for 10.0.0.1 on interface eth1. This will match published proxy ARP entries and
       permanent entries.
