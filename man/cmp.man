NAME
       cmp - compare two files byte by byte

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2 [SKIP1 [SKIP2]]]

DESCRIPTION
       Compare two files byte by byte.

       The  optional  SKIP1  and  SKIP2  specify  the  number of bytes to skip at the beginning of each file (zero by
       default).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --print-bytes
              print differing bytes

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP
              skip first SKIP bytes of both inputs

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP1:SKIP2
              skip first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and first SKIP2 bytes of FILE2

       -l, --verbose
              output byte numbers and differing byte values

       -n, --bytes=LIMIT
              compare at most LIMIT bytes

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              suppress all normal output

       --help display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

       SKIP values may be followed by the following multiplicative  suffixes:  kB  1000,  K  1024,  MB  1,000,000,  M
       1,048,576, GB 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.

       If  a FILE is '-' or missing, read standard input.  Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2
       if trouble.
