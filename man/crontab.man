CRONTAB(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   CRONTAB(1)

NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [ -u user ] file
       crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }

DESCRIPTION
       crontab  is  the  program used to install, deinstall or list the tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon in
       Vixie Cron.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in  /var/spool/cron/crontabs,
       they are not intended to be edited directly.

       If  the  /etc/cron.allow  file  exists,  then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be
       allowed to use this command.  If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny  file  does
       exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command.

       If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super
       user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.

       If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is  not  consid‐
       ered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab.

       Regardless  of the existance of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup
       a crontab.  For standard Debian systems, all users may use this command.

       If the -u option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be used (when listing)  or
       modified (when editing). If this option is not given, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of
       the person executing the command.  Note that su(8) can confuse crontab and that if you are  running  inside
       of su(8) you should always use the -u option for safety's sake.

       The  first  form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some named file or standard input if
       the pseudo-filename ``-'' is given.

       The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output. See the note under DEBIAN SPE‐
       CIFIC below.

       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The  -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR envi‐
       ronment variables.  After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be  installed  automatically.
       If neither of the environment variables is defined, then the default editor /usr/bin/editor is used.

       The  -i  option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before actually removing the
       crontab.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       The "out-of-the-box" behaviour for crontab -l is to display the three line "DO NOT EDIT THIS  FILE"  header
       that  is  placed  at  the  beginning  of the crontab when it is installed. The problem is that it makes the
       sequence

       crontab -l | crontab -

       non-idempotent -- you keep adding copies of the header. This causes pain to scripts that use sed to edit  a
       crontab.  Therefore, the default behaviour of the -l option has been changed to not output such header. You
       may obtain the original behaviour by setting the environment variable CRONTAB_NOHEADER to 'N',  which  will
       cause the crontab -l command to emit the extraneous header.

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs

       There  is  one  file  for  each  user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not
       allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system  to
       run  periodic  tasks  can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there.  This is
       enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring  crontab  command  with
       the setgid bid set for that specific group.

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax differs from pre‐
       vious versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command line.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry in  a  crontab  is
       missing the newline, cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken and refuse to install it.
