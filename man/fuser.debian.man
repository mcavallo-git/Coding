NAME
       fuser - identify processes using files or sockets

SYNOPSIS
       fuser [-fuv] [-a|-s] [-4|-6] [-c|-m|-n space] [ -k [-i] [-M] [-w] [-SIGNAL] ] name ...
       fuser -l
       fuser -V

DESCRIPTION
       fuser  displays  the  PIDs  of processes using the specified files or file systems.  In the default display
       mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:

              c      current directory.
              e      executable being run.
              f      open file.  f is omitted in default display mode.
              F      open file for writing.  F is omitted in default display mode.
              r      root directory.
              m      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              .      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

       fuser returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified files is accessed  or  in  case  of  a  fatal
       error.  If at least one access has been found, fuser returns zero.

       In  order  to  look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the corresponding name space has to be selected
       with the -n option. By default fuser will look in both IPv6 and  IPv4  sockets.   To  change  the  default,
       behavior,  use the -4 and -6 options.  The socket(s) can be specified by the local and remote port, and the
       remote address.  All fields are optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be present:

       [lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]

       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.

       fuser outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Show all files specified on the command line.  By default, only files that are accessed by at  least
              one process are shown.

       -c     Same as -m option, used for POSIX compatibility.

       -f     Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

       -k, --kill
              Kill  processes accessing the file.  Unless changed with -SIGNAL, SIGKILL is sent.  An fuser process
              never kills itself, but may kill other fuser processes.  The effective user ID of the  process  exe‐
              cuting fuser is set to its real user ID before attempting to kill.

       -i, --interactive
              Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process. This option is silently ignored if -k is not
              present too.

       -I, --inode
              For the name space file let all comparisions be based on the inodes of  the  specified  file(s)  and
              never on the file names even on network based file systems.

       -l, --list-signals
              List all known signal names.

       -m NAME, --mount NAME
              NAME  specifies  a  file  on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted.  All processes
              accessing files on that file system are listed.  If a directory file is specified, it  is  automati‐
              cally changed to NAME/.  to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.

       -M, --ismountpoint
              Request will be fulfilled only if NAME specifies a mountpoint.  This is an invaluable seatbelt which
              prevents you from killing the machine if NAME happens to not be a filesystem.

       -w     Kill only processes which have write access.  This option is silently ignored if -k is  not  present
              too.

       -n SPACE, --namespace SPACE
              Select  a  different  name  space.   The  name spaces file (file names, the default), udp (local UDP
              ports), and tcp (local TCP ports) are supported.  For ports, either the port number or the  symbolic
              name can be specified.  If there is no ambiguity, the shortcut notation name/space (e.g. 80/tcp) can
              be used.

       -s, --silent
              Silent operation.  -u and -v are ignored in this mode.  -a must not be used with -s.

       -SIGNAL
              Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing processes.  Signals can be specified either
              by name (e.g.  -HUP)orby number (e.g.  -1).  This option is silently ignored if the -k option is not
              used.

       -u, --user
              Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

       -v, --verbose

              Verbose mode.  Processes are shown in a ps-like style.  The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are similar
              to ps.  ACCESS shows how the process accesses the file.  Verbose mode will also show when a particu‐
              lar file is being accessed as a mount point, knfs export or swap file.  In this case kernel is shown
              instead of the PID.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -4, --ipv4
              Search  only  for  IPv4  sockets.   This  option must not be used with the -6 option and only has an
              effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

       -6, --ipv6
              Search only for IPv6 sockets.  This option must not be used with the  -4  option  and  only  has  an
              effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

       -      Reset all options and set the signal back to SIGKILL.

FILES
       /proc  location of the proc file system

EXAMPLES
       fuser -km /home
              kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any way.

       if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else something; fi
              invokes something if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

       fuser telnet/tcp
              shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.

RESTRICTIONS
       Processes accessing the same file or file system several times in the same way are only shown once.

       If the same object is specified several times on the command line, some of those entries may be ignored.

       fuser  may  only be able to gather partial information unless run with privileges.  As a consequence, files
       opened by processes belonging to other users may not be listed and executables may be classified as  mapped
       only.

       fuser  cannot  report on any processes that it doesn't have permission to look at the file descriptor table
       for.  The most common time this problem occurs is when looking for TCP or UDP sockets when running fuser as
       a non-root user.  In this case fuser will report no access.

       Installing  fuser SUID root will avoid problems associated with partial information, but may be undesirable
       for security and privacy reasons.

       udp and tcp name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets can't be searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.

       Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the -v option.

       The -k option only works on processes.  If the user is the kernel, fuser will print an advice, but take  no
       action beyond that.

BUGS
       fuser  -m  /dev/sgX  will show (or kill with the -k flag) all processes, even if you don't have that device
       configured.  There may be other devices it does this for too.

       The mount -m option will match any file within the same device as the specified file, use the -M option  as
       well if you mean to specify only the mount point.
