GIT-MKTREE(1)                                       Git Manual                                       GIT-MKTREE(1)

NAME
       git-mktree - Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text

SYNOPSIS
       git mktree [-z] [--missing] [--batch]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads standard input in non-recursive ls-tree output format, and creates a tree object. The order of the
       tree entries is normalised by mktree so pre-sorting the input is not required. The object name of the tree
       object built is written to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -z
           Read the NUL-terminated ls-tree -z output instead.

       --missing
           Allow missing objects. The default behaviour (without this option) is to verify that each tree entryâ€™s
           sha1 identifies an existing object. This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries (aka
           "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.

       --batch
           Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting. Each tree is separated by as single blank
           line. The final new-line is optional. Note - if the -z option is used, lines are terminated with NUL.
