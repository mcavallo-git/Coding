GIT-SH-I18N(1)                                      Git Manual                                      GIT-SH-I18N(1)

NAME
       git-sh-i18n - Git's i18n setup code for shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       . "$(git --exec-path)/git-sh-i18n"

DESCRIPTION
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This documentation is meant for people who are
       studying the Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by Gitâ€™s porcelain programs implemented in
       shell script. It provides wrappers for the GNU gettext and eval_gettext functions accessible through the
       gettext.sh script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on systems without GNU gettext.

FUNCTIONS
       gettext
           Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper around printf(1). Will be replaced by
           a real gettext implementation in a later version.

       eval_gettext
           Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper around printf(1) with variables
           expanded by the git-sh-i18n--envsubst(1) helper. Will be replaced by a real gettext implementation in a
           later version.
