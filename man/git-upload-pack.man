GIT-UPLOAD-PACK(1)                                  Git Manual                                  GIT-UPLOAD-PACK(1)

NAME
       git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack

SYNOPSIS
       git-upload-pack [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=<n>] [--stateless-rpc]
                         [--advertise-refs] <directory>
       DESCRIPTION

       Invoked by 'git fetch-pack', learns what
       objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
       The UI for the protocol is on the 'git fetch-pack' side, and the
       program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
       repository.  For push operations, see 'git send-pack'.

       OPTIONS

       --[no-]strict
           Do not try <directory>/.git/ if <directory> is no Git directory.

       --timeout=<n>
           Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.

       --stateless-rpc
           Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout. This fits with the HTTP POST request
           processing model where a program may read the request, write a response, and must exit.

       --advertise-refs
           Only the initial ref advertisement is output, and the program exits immediately. This fits with the
           HTTP GET request model, where no request content is received but a response must be produced.

       <directory>
           The repository to sync from.
