GIT-VAR(1)                                          Git Manual                                          GIT-VAR(1)

NAME
       git-var - Show a Git logical variable

SYNOPSIS
       git var ( -l | <variable> )

DESCRIPTION
       Prints a Git logical variable.

OPTIONS
       -l
           Cause the logical variables to be listed. In addition, all the variables of the Git configuration file
           .git/config are listed as well. (However, the configuration variables listing functionality is
           deprecated in favor of git config -l.)

EXAMPLE
           $ git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
           Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@lnxi.com> 1121223278 -0600

VARIABLES
       GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
           The author of a piece of code.

       GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
           The person who put a piece of code into Git.

       GIT_EDITOR
           Text editor for use by Git commands. The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell when it is used.
           Examples: ~/bin/vi, $SOME_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, "C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe" --nofork. The order of
           preference is the $GIT_EDITOR environment variable, then core.editor configuration, then $VISUAL, then
           $EDITOR, and then the default chosen at compile time, which is usually vi.

       GIT_PAGER
           Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., less). The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell.
           The order of preference is the $GIT_PAGER environment variable, then core.pager configuration, then
           $PAGER, and then the default chosen at compile time (usually less).
