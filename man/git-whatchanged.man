GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)                                  Git Manual                                  GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)

NAME
       git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces

SYNOPSIS
       git whatchanged <option>...

DESCRIPTION
       Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

       New users are encouraged to use git-log(1) instead. The whatchanged command is essentially the same as git-
       log(1) but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.

       The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of many people who learned Git long before
       git log was invented by reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.

EXAMPLES
       git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
           Show as patches the commits since version v2.6.12 that changed any file in the include/scsi or
           drivers/scsi subdirectories

       git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk. The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion
           with the branch named gitk
