GPASSWD(1)                                         User Commands                                        GPASSWD(1)

NAME
       gpasswd - administer /etc/group and /etc/gshadow

SYNOPSIS
       gpasswd [option] group

DESCRIPTION
       The gpasswd command is used to administer /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow. Every group can have
       administrators, members and a password.

       System administrators can use the -A option to define group administrator(s) and the -M option to define
       members. They have all rights of group administrators and members.

       gpasswd called by a group administrator with a group name only prompts for the new password of the group.

       If a password is set the members can still use newgrp(1) without a password, and non-members must supply
       the password.

   Notes about group passwords
       Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than one person is permitted to know the
       password. However, groups are a useful tool for permitting co-operation between different users.

OPTIONS
       Except for the -A and -M options, the options cannot be combined.

       The options which apply to the gpasswd command are:

       -a, --add user
           Add the user to the named group.

       -d, --delete user
           Remove the user from the named group.

       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -Q, --root CHROOT_DIR
           Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR
           directory.

       -r, --remove-password
           Remove the password from the named group. The group password will be empty. Only group members will be
           allowed to use newgrp to join the named group.

       -R, --restrict
           Restrict the access to the named group. The group password is set to "!". Only group members with a
           password will be allowed to use newgrp to join the named group.

       -A, --administrators user,...
           Set the list of administrative users.

       -M, --members user,...
           Set the list of group members.

CAVEATS
       This tool only operates on the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.  Thus you cannot change any NIS or LDAP
       group. This must be performed on the corresponding server.

CONFIGURATION
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:

       ENCRYPT_METHOD (string)
           This defines the system default encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are
           specified on the command line).

           It can take one of these values: DES (default), MD5, SHA256, SHA512.

           Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB variable.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with the
           PAM configuration.

       MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in
           /etc/group (with the same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file. This is useful to
           make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use
           this variable unless you really need it.

       MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean)
           Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm. If set to yes, new passwords
           will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of
           FreeBSD. It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to no if you need to
           copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don't understand the new algorithm. Default is no.

           This variable is superseded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable or by any command line option used to
           configure the encryption algorithm.

           This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with the
           PAM configuration.

       SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS (number)
           When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512, this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the
           encryption algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the command line).

           With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password. But note also that more CPU
           resources will be needed to authenticate users.

           If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).

           The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

           If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value will be
           used.

           If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS > SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the highest value will be used.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with the
           PAM configuration.
