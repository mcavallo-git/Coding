NAME
       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       /bin   This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it.

       /boot  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only the files which are needed during the boot process.  The map installer and con‐
              figuration files should go to /sbin and /etc.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either / or /boot.

       /dev   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.  See mknod(1).

       /etc   Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.  Some larger software packages, like X11, can have their own subdirectories below  /etc.
              Site-wide  configuration files may be placed here or in /usr/etc.  Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in /etc and you may have
              links for these files to /usr/etc.

       /etc/opt
              Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed in /opt.

       /etc/sgml
              This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).

       /etc/skel
              When a new user account is created, files from this directory are usually copied into the user's home directory.

       /etc/X11
              Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).

       /etc/xml
              This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).

       /home  On machines with home directories for users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly or not.  The structure of this directory  depends  on
              local administration decisions (optional).

       /lib   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to run the commands in the root filesystem.

       /lib<qual>
              These directories are variants of /lib on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries (optional).

       /lib/modules
              Loadable kernel modules (optional).

       /lost+found
              This  directory contains items lost in the filesystem.  These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of a faulty disk or a system
              crash.

       /media This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.  On systems where more than one  device  exists  for
              mounting  a  certain type of media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with '0', but
              the unqualified name must also exist.

       /media/floppy[1-9]
              Floppy drive (optional).

       /media/cdrom[1-9]
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       /media/cdrecorder[1-9]
              CD writer (optional).

       /media/zip[1-9]
              Zip drive (optional).

       /media/usb[1-9]
              USB drive (optional).

       /mnt   This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.  In some distributions, /mnt contains subdirectories intended  to  be  used  as
              mount points for several temporary filesystems.

       /opt   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.

       /proc  This  is  a  mount  point  for the proc filesystem, which provides information about running processes and the kernel.  This pseudo-filesystem is de‐
              scribed in more detail in proc(5).

       /root  This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

       /sbin  Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by normal users.

       /srv   This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

       /sys   This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel like /proc, but better structured, following the  formal‐
              ism of kobject infrastructure.

       /tmp   This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at system boot up.

       /usr   This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.  It should hold only shareable, read-only data, so that it can be mounted by various ma‐
              chines running Linux.

       /usr/X11R6
              The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (optional).

       /usr/X11R6/bin
              Binaries which belong to the X-Window system; often, there is a symbolic link from the more traditional /usr/bin/X11 to here.

       /usr/X11R6/lib
              Data files associated with the X-Window system.

       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
              These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;  Often, there is a symbolic link from /usr/lib/X11 to this directory.

       /usr/X11R6/include/X11
              Contains include files needed for compiling programs using the X11 window system.  Often, there is a symbolic link from /usr/include/X11 to this  di‐
              rectory.

       /usr/bin
              This  is the primary directory for executable programs.  Most programs executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or for repairing the
              system and which are not installed locally should be placed in this directory.

       /usr/bin/mh
              Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

       /usr/bin/X11
              is the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/bin.

       /usr/dict
              Replaced by /usr/share/dict.

       /usr/doc
              Replaced by /usr/share/doc.

       /usr/etc
              Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several machines may be stored in this directory.  However, commands should always reference those
              files using the /etc directory.  Links from files in /etc should point to the appropriate files in /usr/etc.

       /usr/games
              Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).

       /usr/include
              Include files for the C compiler.

       /usr/include/bsd
              BSD compatibility include files (optional).

       /usr/include/X11
              Include files for the C compiler and the X-Window system.  This is usually a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/include/X11.

       /usr/include/asm
              Include files which declare some assembler functions.  This used to be a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/asm.

       /usr/include/linux
              This  contains  information  which may change from system release to system release and used to be a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux to
              get at operating-system-specific information.

              (Note that one should have include files there that work correctly with the current libc and in user space.  However, Linux kernel source is not  de‐
              signed  to  be  used with user programs and does not know anything about the libc you are using.  It is very likely that things will break if you let
              /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux point at a random kernel tree.  Debian systems don't do this and use headers from a known  good  kernel  ver‐
              sion, provided in the libc*-dev package.)

       /usr/include/g++
              Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.

       /usr/lib
              Object  libraries,  including  dynamic  libraries,  plus some executables which usually are not invoked directly.  More complicated programs may have
              whole subdirectories there.

       /usr/lib<qual>
              These directories are variants of /usr/lib on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries, except that the symbolic
              link /usr/lib<qual>/X11 is not required (optional).

       /usr/lib/X11
              The  usual place for data files associated with X programs, and configuration files for the X system itself.  On Linux, it usually is a symbolic link
              to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11.

       /usr/lib/gcc-lib
              contains executables and include files for the GNU C compiler, gcc(1).

       /usr/lib/groff
              Files for the GNU groff document formatting system.

              pair.

       /usr/share
              This  directory  contains  subdirectories with specific application data, that can be shared among different architectures of the same OS.  Often one
              finds stuff here that used to live in /usr/doc or /usr/lib or /usr/man.

       /usr/share/dict

       /usr/src/linux
              This was the traditional place for the kernel source.  Some distributions put here the source for the default kernel they ship.  You should  probably
              use another directory when building your own kernel.

       /usr/tmp
              Obsolete.  This should be a link to /var/tmp.  This link is present only for compatibility reasons and shouldn't be used.

              Variable data for /usr/local.

       /var/lock
              Lock  files  are  placed  in this directory.  The naming convention for device lock files is LCK..<device> where <device> is the device's name in the
              filesystem.  The format used is that of HDU UUCP lock files, that is, lock files contain a PID as a 10-byte ASCII decimal number, followed by a  new‐
