NAME
       iostat - Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and input/output statistics for devices and partitions.

SYNOPSIS
       iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -N ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] [ --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 } ] [ { -f | +f } directory ]
       [ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ] [ -o JSON ] [ [ -H ] -g group_name ] [ --human ] [ --pretty ] [ -p [ device[,...] | ALL ] ] [
       device [...] | ALL ] [ interval [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to
       their average transfer rates. The iostat command generates reports that can be used to change system configuration to better balance the
       input/output load between physical disks.

       The first report generated by the iostat command provides statistics concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the -y option
       is used (in this case, this first report is omitted).  Each subsequent report covers the time since the previous report. All statistics are
       reported each time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a CPU header row followed by a row of CPU statistics. On
       multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated system-wide as averages among all processors. A device header row is displayed
       followed by a line of statistics for each device that is configured.

       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report. The count parameter can be specified in conjunction
       with the interval parameter. If the count parameter is specified, the value of count determines the number of reports generated at interval
       seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified without the count parameter, the iostat command generates reports continuously.

REPORTS
       The iostat command generates two types of reports, the CPU Utilization report and the Device Utilization report.

       CPU Utilization Report
              The first report generated by the iostat command is the CPU Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU values are
              global averages among all processors.  The report has the following format:

              %user  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).

              %nice  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.

              %system
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).

              %iowait
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.

              %steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another
                     virtual processor.

              %idle  Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

       Device Utilization Report
              The second report generated by the iostat command is the Device Utilization Report.  The device report provides statistics on a per
              physical device or partition basis. Block devices and partitions for which statistics are to be displayed may be entered on the
              command line.  If no device nor partition is entered, then statistics are displayed for every device used by the system, and
              providing that the kernel maintains statistics for it.  If the ALL keyword is given on the command line, then statistics are
              displayed for every device defined by the system, including those that have never been used.  Transfer rates are shown in 1K blocks
              by default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.  The report may show the
              following fields, depending on the flags used (e.g.  -x, -s and -k or -m):

              Device:
                     This column gives the device (or partition) name as listed in the /dev directory.

              tps    Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. A transfer is an I/O request to the device.
                     Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.

              Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data read from the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second. Blocks
                     are equivalent to sectors and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.

              Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data written to the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.

              Blk_dscd/s (kB_dscd/s, MB_dscd/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data discarded for the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.

              Blk_w+d/s (kB_w+d/s, MB_w+d/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data written to or discarded for the device expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per
                     second.

              Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

              Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) written.

              Blk_dscd (kB_dscd, MB_dscd)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) discarded.

              Blk_w+d (kB_w+d, MB_w+d)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) written or discarded.

              r/s    The number (after merges) of read requests completed per second for the device.

              w/s    The number (after merges) of write requests completed per second for the device.

              d/s    The number (after merges) of discard requests completed per second for the device.

              f/s    The number (after merges) of flush requests completed per second for the device.  This counts flush requests executed by
                     disks. Flush requests are not tracked for partitions.  Before being merged, flush operations are counted as writes.

              sec/s (kB/s, MB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from, written to or discarded for the device per second.

              rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from the device per second.

              wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to the device per second.

              dsec/s (dkB/s, dMB/s)

              rqm/s  The number of I/O requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              rrqm/s The number of read requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              wrqm/s The number of write requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              drqm/s The number of discard requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              %rrqm  The percentage of read requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              %wrqm  The percentage of write requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              %drqm  The percentage of discard requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              areq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              rareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the read requests that were issued to the device.

              wareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the write requests that were issued to the device.

              dareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the discard requests that were issued to the device.

              await  The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the
                     requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              r_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for read requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the
                     requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              w_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for write requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the
                     requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              d_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for discard requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by
                     the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              f_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for flush requests issued to the device to be served.  The block layer combines flush
                     requests and executes at most one at a time.  Thus flush operations could be twice as long: Wait for current flush request,
                     then execute it, then wait for the next one.

              aqu-sz The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as avgqu-sz.

              %util  Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device
                     saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially.  But for devices serving requests
                     in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits.

OPTIONS
       -c     Display the CPU utilization report.

       -d     Display the device utilization report.

       --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2, default value is 2).

       -f directory
       +f directory
              Specify an alternative directory for iostat to read devices statistics. Option -f tells iostat to use only the files located in the
              alternative directory, whereas option +f tells it to use both the standard kernel files and the files located in the alternative
              directory to read device statistics.

              directory is a directory containing files with statistics for devices managed in userspace.  It may contain:

              - a "diskstats" file whose format is compliant with that located in "/proc",
              - statistics for individual devices contained in files whose format is compliant with that of files located in "/sys".

              In particular, the following files located in directory may be used by iostat:

              directory/block/device/stat
              directory/block/device/partition/stat

              partition files must have an entry in directory/dev/block/ directory, e.g.:

              directory/dev/block/major:minor --> ../../block/device/partition

       -g group_name { device [...] | ALL }
              Display statistics for a group of devices.  The iostat command reports statistics for each individual device in the list then a line
              of global statistics for the group displayed as group_name and made up of all the devices in the list. The ALL keyword means that
              all the block devices defined by the system shall be included in the group.

       -H     This option must be used with option -g and indicates that only global statistics for the group are to be displayed, and not
              statistics for individual devices in the group.

       -h     This option is equivalent to specifying --human --pretty.

       --human
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1.0k, 1.2M, etc.)  The units displayed with this option supersede any other default units
              (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with the metrics.

       -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] | ALL ]
              Display persistent device names. Keywords ID, LABEL, etc. specify the type of the persistent name. These keywords are not limited,
              only prerequisite is that directory with required persistent names is present in /dev/disk.  Optionally, multiple devices can be
              specified in the chosen persistent name type.  Because persistent device names are usually long, option --pretty is implicitly set
              with this option.

       -k     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.

       -m     Display statistics in megabytes per second.

       -N     Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.

       -o JSON
              Display the statistics in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format.  JSON output field order is undefined, and new fields may be
              added in the future.

       -p [ { device[,...] | ALL } ]
              Display statistics for block devices and all their partitions that are used by the system.  If a device name is entered on the
              command line, then statistics for it and all its partitions are displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates that statistics have to
              be displayed for all the block devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have never been used. If option -j
              is defined before this option, devices entered on the command line can be specified with the chosen persistent name type.

       --pretty
              Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by a human.

       -s     Display a short (narrow) version of the report that should fit in 80 characters wide screens.

       -t     Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format may depend on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable
              (see below).

       -V     Print version number then exit.

       -x     Display extended statistics.

       -y     Omit first report with statistics since system boot, if displaying multiple records at given interval.

       -z     Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity during the sample period.

ENVIRONMENT
       The iostat command takes into account the following environment variables:

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              When this variable is set, transfer rates are shown in 512-byte blocks instead of the default 1K blocks.

       S_COLORS
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to change the settings.
              Possible values for this variable are never, always or auto (the latter is equivalent to the default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of issue
              simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-separated list of
              capabilities that defaults to H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22.  Supported capabilities are:

              H=     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.

              I=     SGR substring for device names.

              M=     SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.

              N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              Z=     SGR substring for zero values.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header.
              The iostat command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp displayed with option -t will also be compliant
              with ISO 8601 format.

EXAMPLES
       iostat Display a single history since boot report for all CPU and Devices.

       iostat -d 2
              Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.

       iostat -d 2 6
              Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.

       iostat -x sda sdb 2 6
              Display six reports of extended statistics at two second intervals for devices sda and sdb.

       iostat -p sda 2 6
              Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda and all its partitions (sda1, etc.)

BUGS
       /proc filesystem must be mounted for iostat to work.

       Kernels older than 2.6.x are no longer supported.

       Although iostat speaks of kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB)..., it actually uses kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes (MiB)...  A kibibyte is equal to
       1024 bytes, and a mebibyte is equal to 1024 kibibytes.

FILES
       /proc/stat contains system statistics.
       /proc/uptime contains system uptime.
       /proc/diskstats contains disks statistics.
       /sys contains statistics for block devices.
       /proc/self/mountstats contains statistics for network filesystems.
       /dev/disk contains persistent device names.
