lsb_release(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                 lsb_release(1)

NAME
       lsb_release - print distribution-specific information

SYNOPSIS
       lsb_release [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The lsb_release command provides certain LSB (Linux Standard Base) and distribution-specific information.

       If no options are given, the -v option is assumed.

OPTIONS
       The  program  follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`--').  A
       summary of options are included below.

       -v, --version
              Show the version of the LSB against which your current  installation  is  compliant.   The  version  is
              expressed as a colon separated list of LSB module descriptions.

       -i, --id
              Display the distributor's ID.

       -d, --description
              Display a description of the currently installed distribution.

       -r, --release
              Display the release number of the currently installed distribution.

       -c, --codename
              Display the code name of the currently installed distribution.

       -a, --all
              Display all of the above information.

       -s, --short
              Use the short output format for any information displayed.  This format omits the leading header(s).

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

NOTES
       This  is  a  reimplementation  of  the lsb_release command provided by the Free Standards Group.  Any bugs are
       solely the responsibility of the author below.

       Detection of systems using a mix of packages from various distributions or releases is something  of  a  black
       art;  the  current  heuristic  tends  to assume that the installation is of the earliest distribution which is
       still being used by apt but that heuristic is subject to error.
