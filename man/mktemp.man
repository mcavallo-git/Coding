NAME
       mktemp - create a temporary file or directory

SYNOPSIS
       mktemp [OPTION]... [TEMPLATE]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.  TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive 'X's in last component.  If
       TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX, and --tmpdir is implied.  Files are created u+rw, and directories u+rwx, minus umask
       restrictions.

       -d, --directory
              create a directory, not a file

       -u, --dry-run
              do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)

       -q, --quiet
              suppress diagnostics about file/dir-creation failure

       --suffix=SUFF
              append SUFF to TEMPLATE; SUFF must not contain a slash.  This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not end in X

       -p DIR, --tmpdir[=DIR]
              interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR; if DIR is not specified, use $TMPDIR if set, else /tmp.  With this option, TEMPLATE must not be
              an absolute name; unlike with -t, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but mktemp creates only the final component

       -t     interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component, relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the directory specified via -p;
              else /tmp [deprecated]

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
