NAME
       MultiTail - browse through several files at once

SYNOPSIS
       multitail [options]

       options: [-cs|-Cs|-c-] [-s] [-i] inputfile [-i anotherinputfile] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The program MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail program. The difference is that it creates multiple
       windows on your console (with ncurses). It can also monitor wildcards: if another file matching the wildcard has a more recent modification
       date, it will automatically switch to that file. That way you can, for example, monitor a complete directory of files. Merging of 2 or even
       more logfiles is possible. It can also use colors while displaying the logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of
       what is important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with regular expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given
       regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can also have windows with the output of shell scripts and other software. When
       viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the functionality of tools like 'watch' and such. When new mail arrives for
       the current user, the statuslines will become green. To reset this "mail has arrived"-state, press ' ' (a space). For help at any time,
       press F1.

OPTIONS
       -i file
              Select a file to monitor. You can have multiple -i file parameters.  You only need to add -i file in front of a filename if the
              filename starts with a dash ('-').

       -I file
              Same as -i file but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).

       -iw file interval
              -Iw file interval Like '-i'/'-I' but expects the parameter to be a wildcard and the second(!) an interval.  Initially MultiTail will
              start monitoring the first file with the most recent modification time. Every interval it will check if any new files were created
              (or modified) and start tailing that one. *Don't forget* to put quotation marks around the filename as otherwhise the shell will try
              to substitute them!

       -l command
              Command to execute in a window. Parameter is the command. Do not forget to use "'s if the external command needs parameter! (e.g. -l
              "ping host").

       -L command
              Same as -l but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).

       -j     Read from stdin (can be used only once as there is only 1 stdin).

       -J     Same as -j but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).

       --mergeall
              Merge all of the following files into the same window (see '--no-mergeall').

       --no-mergeall
              Stop merging all files into one window (see '--mergeall');

       --no-repeat
              When the same line is repeated, it will be suppressed while printing a "Last message repeated x times" message.

       --mark-interval x
              Print every 'x' seconds a mark-line when nothing else was printed.

       -q i path
              Check path for new files with interval 'i', all in new windows. One can enter paths here understood by the shell. E.g. "/tmp/*".
              Note: do not forget to add quotes around the pathname to prevent the shell from parsing it!

       -Q i path
              Like -q: but merge them all in one window.

       --new-only
              For -q/-Q: only create windows for files created after MultiTail was started.

       --closeidle x
              Close windows when more then 'x' seconds no new data was processed.

       -a x   Write the output also to file 'x' (like 'tee') AFTER it was filtered by MultiTail.

       -A x   Write the output also to file 'x' (like 'tee') BEFORE it was filtered by MultiTail.

       -g x   Send the output also to command 'x' AFTER it was filtered by MultiTail.

       -G x   Send the output also to command 'x' BEFORE it was filtered by MultiTail.

       -S     Prepend merged output with subwindow-number.

       -t title
              With this switch, "title" is displayed in the statusline instead of the filename or commandline.

       -n number_of_lines
              Number of lines to tail initially. The default depends on the size of the terminal-window.

       -N number_of_lines
              Like -n but this parameter will be used for all files/commands you tail after this parameter.

       -r interval
              Restart the command (started with -l/-L) after it has exited. With interval you can set how long to sleep before restarting.

       -R interval
              Restarts a command like -r only this one shows the difference in output compared to the previous run.

       -rc / -Rc interval
              Like -r / -R but clears the window before each iteration.

       -h     The help.

       -f     Follow the following filename, not the descriptor.

       --follow-all
              For all files after this switch: follow the following filename, not the descriptor.

       -fr filter
              Use the predefined filter(s) from the configfile.

       -e     Use the next regular expression on the following file.

       -ex    Use regular expression on the following file and execute the command when it matches. The command gets as commandline parameter the
              whole matching line.

       -eX    Like '-ex' but only give the matching substring as parameter. This requires a regular expression with '(' and ')'.

       -ec    Use regular expression on the following file and display the matches.

       -eC    Use regular expression on the following file but display everything and display the matches inverted.

       -E     Use the next regular expression on the following files.

       -v     Negate the next regular expression.

       -s x   Splits the screen vertically in 'x' columns.

       -sw x  At what position to split the screen. e.g. '-sw 20,40,,10' (=4 columns)

       -sn x  How many windows per column for vertical split (use with -s or -sw). e.g. '-sn 3,,2'.

       -wh x  Sets the height of a window (advisory: if it won't fit, the height is adjusted).

       -cS scheme
              Show the next given file using the colorscheme selected with 'scheme' (as defined in multitail.conf).

       -CS scheme
              Show all following files using the colorscheme selected with 'scheme' (as defined in multitail.conf).

              Let the terminal beep for every x-th line processed. Press 'i' in the main menu to see how many times it beeped.

       --bi x Like '--beep-interval' but only for current (sub-)window. Statistics on the number of beeps can be found in the statistics for this
              (sub-)window. Press 't' in the main menu.

       -H     Show heartbeat (to keep your sessions alive).

       -V     Show the version and exit.

KEYS
       You can press a couple of keys while the program runs.  To see a list of them, press F1 (or ^h). You can press F1 (or ^h) at any time: it
       gives you context related information.  Press 'q' to exit the program.

EXAMPLES
       See http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/examples.html for more and other examples.

       multitail /var/log/apache/access_log logfile -i -filestartingwithdatsh
              This creates three windows. One with the contents of /var/log/apache/access_log, one with the contents of logfile and so on.

       multitail -R 2 -l "netstat -t"
              This runs netstat every 2 seconds and then shows what has changed since the previous run. That way one can see new connections being
              made and closed connections fading away.

       multitail logfile -l "ping 192.168.1.3"
              This creates two windows. One with the contents of logfile, one with with the output of 'ping 192.168.1.3'.

       multitail /var/log/apache/access_log -I /var/log/apache/error_log
              This creates one window with the contents of /var/log/apache/access_log merged with the contents of /var/log/apache/error_log.

       multitail -M 0 /var/log/apache/access_log -I /var/log/apache/error_log
              Same as previous example. This example will store all logged entries in a buffer so that you can later on browse through them (by
              pressing ' b
               ').

BUGS
       As this program grew larger and larger over the time with new functionality sometimes added ad-hoc, some bugs may have been introduced.
       Please notify folkert@vanheusden.com if you find any.

       Well, except for the resizing of your terminal window. The program might crash when doing such things. Upgrading the ncurses library to at
       least version 5.3 might help in that case.
