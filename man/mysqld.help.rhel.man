Starts the MySQL database server.

Usage: mysqld [OPTIONS]

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /usr/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-5.7
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any option file,
                        except for login file.
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
                        Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=#          Read this path from the login file.

  --abort-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
                      are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
                      requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
                      operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
                      removed in a future release.
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
                      file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
                      CRC32; default is CRC32.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log.
                      Before using this option make sure that there are no
                      dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
                      tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
                      SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
                      from the master.
  --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
                      database, and exclude all others not explicitly
                      mentioned.
  --binlog-error-action=name 
                      When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
                      to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
                      and let the master continue, or abort.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      What form of binary logging the master will use: either
                      ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
                      statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
                      statement-based binary logging except for those
                      statements where only row-based is correct: those which
                      involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
                      function; for those, row-based binary logging is
                      automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
                      binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
                      and back implicitly per each query accessing an
                      NDBCLUSTER table
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
                      The number of microseconds the server waits for the
                      binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
                      continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
                      If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
                      queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
                      be enqueued (as set using
                      --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
                      resumes.
  --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
                      If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
                      than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
                      GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
                      binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
                      useful when the server has already generated many binary
                      logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
                      Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
                      GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
                      cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
                      or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
                      OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
                      binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
                      GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
                      generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
                      or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
                      later restarted with this option disabled.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the master that updates to the given database
                      should not be logged to the binary log.
  --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
                      The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
                      keep reading transactions before it flush the
                      transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
                      depending on the value of sync_binlog).
  --binlog-order-commits 
                      Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
                      transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
                      order commits.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
                      Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance
  --blackhole[=name]  Enable or disable BLACKHOLE plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --block-encryption-mode=name 
                      mode for AES_ENCRYPT/AES_DECRYPT
  --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)
  --character-set-filesystem=name 
                      Set the filesystem character set.
  -C, --character-set-server=name 
                      Set the default character set.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory where character sets are
  --check-proxy-users If set to FALSE (the default), then proxy user identity
                      will not be mapped for authentication plugins which
                      support mapping from grant tables.  When set to TRUE,
                      users associated with authentication plugins which signal
                      proxy user mapping should be done according to GRANT
                      PROXY privilege definition.
  -r, --chroot=name   Chroot mysqld daemon during startup.
  --collation-server=name 
                      Set the default collation.
  --completion-type=name 
                      The transaction completion type, one of NO_CHAIN, CHAIN,
                      RELEASE
  --concurrent-insert[=name] 
                      Use concurrent insert with MyISAM. Possible values are
                      NEVER, AUTO, ALWAYS
  --connect-timeout=# The number of seconds the mysqld server is waiting for a
                      connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'
  --console           Write error output on screen; don't remove the console
                      window on windows.
  --core-file         Write core on errors.
  --daemonize         Run mysqld as sysv daemon

  --date-format=name  The DATE format (ignored)
  --datetime-format=name 
                      The DATETIME format (ignored)
  --default-authentication-plugin=name 
                      The default authentication plugin used by the server to
                      hash the password.
  --default-password-lifetime=# 
                      The number of days after which the password will expire.
  --default-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for new tables
  --default-time-zone=name 
                      Set the default time zone.
  --default-tmp-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for new explict temporary
                      tables
  --default-week-format=# 
                      The default week format used by WEEK() functions
  --delay-key-write[=name] 
                      Type of DELAY_KEY_WRITE
  --delayed-insert-limit=# 
                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing. This variable is deprecated along with
                      INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating. This variable is
                      deprecated along with INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-queue-size=# 
                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again. This variable is deprecated
                      along with INSERT DELAYED.
  --des-key-file=name Load keys for des_encrypt() and des_encrypt from given
                      file.
  --disable-partition-engine-check 
                      Skip the check for non-natively partitioned tables during
                      bootstrap. This option is deprecated along with the
                      partition engine.
  --disabled-storage-engines=name 
                      Limit CREATE TABLE for the storage engines listed
  --disconnect-on-expired-password 
                      Give clients that don't signal password expiration
                      support execution time error(s) instead of connection
                      error
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-disconnect-on-expired-password to disable.)
  --disconnect-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --div-precision-increment=# 
                      Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
                      on that value
  --early-plugin-load=name 
                      Optional semicolon-separated list of plugins to load
                      before storage engine initialization, where each plugin
                      is identified as name=library, where name is the plugin
                      name and library is the plugin library in plugin_dir.
  --end-markers-in-json 
                      In JSON output ("EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON" and optimizer
                      trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
                      key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
  --enforce-gtid-consistency[=name] 
                      Prevents execution of statements that would be impossible
                      to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
                      disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
                      inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
                      tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
  --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
                      The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
                      of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
                      equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
                      this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; possible purges happen at startup
                      and at binary log rotation
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
                      variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
                      privilege.
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
                      Disable with --skip-external-locking.
  --federated[=name]  Enable or disable FEDERATED plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --flush             Flush MyISAM tables to disk between SQL commands
  --flush-time=#      A dedicated thread is created to flush all tables at the
                      given interval
  --ft-boolean-syntax=name 
                      List of operators for MATCH ... AGAINST ( ... IN BOOLEAN
                      MODE)

  --gtid-executed-compression-period[=#] 
                      When binlog is disabled, a background thread wakes up to
                      compress the gtid_executed table every
                      gtid_executed_compression_period transactions, as a
                      special case, if variable is 0, the thread never wakes up
                      to compress the gtid_executed table.
  --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
                      are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
                      or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
                      OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
                      a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
                      assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
                      allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
                      that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
                      transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
                      means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
                      on a master before any slave can use
                      MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
                      first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
                      servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
                      without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
                      servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

                      When turned OFF, InnoDB will assume that the zlib
                      compression algorithm doesn't change.

                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage

                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
                      If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
                      row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
                      version of events are written.  This option is useful
                      during some upgrades.

                      use in debugging, not production as sensitive information
                      may be logged.
  --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
                      logs.
  --log-slave-updates Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread
                      to the binary log. You will need to turn it on if you
                      plan to daisy-chain the slaves
  --log-slow-admin-statements 
                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other

  --log-syslog        Errors, warnings, and similar issues eligible for MySQL's
                      error log file may additionally be sent to the host
                      operating system's system log ("syslog").
  --log-syslog-facility=name 
                      When logging issues using the host operating system's
                      syslog, identify as a facility of the given type (to aid

  --log-syslog-include-pid 
                      When logging issues using the host operating system's
                      syslog, include this MySQL server's process ID (PID).
                      This setting does not affect MySQL's own error log file.

                      syslog, tag the entries from this particular MySQL server
                      with this ident. This will help distinguish entries from
                      MySQL servers co-existing on the same host machine. A
                      non-empty tag will be appended to the default ident of
                      'mysqld', connected by a hyphen.
  --log-tc=name       Path to transaction coordinator log (used for
                      transactions that affect more than one storage engine,

                      Log at most this many 'not using index' warnings per
                      minute to the slow log. Any further warnings will be
                      condensed into a single summary line. A value of 0
                      disables throttling. Option has no effect unless
                      --log_queries_not_using_indexes is set.
  --log-timestamps=name 
                      UTC to timestamp log files in zulu time, for more concise
                      timestamps and easier correlation of logs from servers
                      from multiple time zones, or SYSTEM to use the system's

                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search; 1 - prune
                      plans based on number of retrieved rows
  --optimizer-search-depth=# 
                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will

                      Maximum amount of memory used by the range optimizer to
                      allocate predicates during range analysis. The larger the
                      number, more memory may be consumed during range
                      analysis. If the value is too low to completed range
                      optimization of a query, index range scan will not be
                      considered for this query. A value of 0 means range
                      optimizer does not have any cap on memory. 
  --read-buffer-size=# 
                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value
  --read-only         Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the
                      exception for replication (slave) threads and users with
                      the SUPER privilege
  --read-rnd-buffer-size=# 
                      When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows

                      the SQL replication thread is in the relay logs
  --relay-log-info-repository=name 
                      Defines the type of the repository for the relay log
                      information and associated workers.
  --relay-log-purge   if disabled - do not purge relay logs. if enabled - purge
                      them as soon as they are no more needed
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
  --relay-log-recovery 
                      Enables automatic relay log recovery right after the
                      database startup, which means that the IO Thread starts
                      re-fetching from the master right after the last
                      transaction processed
  --relay-log-space-limit=# 
                      Maximum space to use for all relay logs
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
                      SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
                      slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
                      not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
                      the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
                      NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
                      for connecting to the slave from the master or other
                      hosts
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset
  --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --require-secure-transport 
                      When this option is enabled, connections attempted using
                      insecure transport will be rejected.  Secure transports
                      are SSL/TLS, Unix socket or Shared Memory (on Windows).

                      (pre-4.1) passwords. Deprecated. Always TRUE.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)
  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory
  --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
                      of replication partners
  --server-id-bits=#  Set number of significant bits in server-id
  --session-track-gtids=name 
                      Controls the amount of global transaction ids to be
                      included in the response packet sent by the
                      server.(Default: OFF).
  --session-track-schema 
                      Track changes to the 'default schema'.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-session-track-schema to disable.)

  --session-track-system-variables=name 
                      Track changes in registered system variables.
  --session-track-transaction-info=name 
                      Track changes to the transaction attributes. OFF to
                      disable; STATE to track just transaction state (Is there
                      an active transaction? Does it have any data? etc.);
                      CHARACTERISTICS to track transaction state and report all
                      statements needed to start a transaction with the same
                      characteristics (isolation level, read only/read write,
                      snapshot - but not any work done / data modified within
                      the transaction).
  --sha256-password-proxy-users 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then the sha256_password
                      authentication plugin will not signal for authenticated
                      users to be checked for mapping to proxy users.  When set
                      to TRUE, the plugin will flag associated authenticated
                      accounts to be mapped to proxy users when the server
                      option check_proxy_users is enabled.

                      TABLE_SCAN and HASH_SCAN. Any combination is allowed, and
                      the slave will always pick the most suitable algorithm
                      for any given scenario. (Default: INDEX_SCAN,
                      TABLE_SCAN).
  --slave-skip-errors=name

                      checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
                      network before writing them to the relay log. Enabled by
                      default.

                      Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. Legal
                      values are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions,
                      ALL_NON_LOSSY to enable non-lossy conversions,
                      ALL_UNSIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
                      unsigned values, and ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer
                      column type data to be signed values. Default treatment
                      is ALL_SIGNED. If ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are
                      specified, ALL_SIGNED will take higher priority than
                      ALL_UNSIGNED. If the variable is assigned the empty set,
                      no conversions are allowed and it is expected that the
                      types match exactly.

                      used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
                      Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
                      of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
