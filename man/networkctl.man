NAME
       networkctl - Query the status of network links

SYNOPSIS
       networkctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [LINK...]

DESCRIPTION
       networkctl may be used to introspect the state of the network links as seen by systemd-networkd. Please refer to systemd-networkd.service(8) for an introduction
       to the basic concepts, functionality, and configuration syntax.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -a --all
           Show all links with status.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-legend
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       list [LINK...]
           Show a list of existing links and their status. If no further arguments are specified shows all links, otherwise just the specified links. Produces output
           similar to:

               IDX LINK         TYPE     OPERATIONAL SETUP
                 1 lo           loopback carrier     unmanaged
                 2 eth0         ether    routable    configured
                 3 virbr0       ether    no-carrier  unmanaged
                 4 virbr0-nic   ether    off         unmanaged

               4 links listed.

       status [LINK...]
           Show information about the specified links: type, state, kernel module driver, hardware and IP address, configured DNS servers, etc.

           When no links are specified, an overall network status is shown. Also see the option --all.

           Produces output similar to:

               ‚óè      State: routable
                    Address: 10.193.76.5 on eth0
                             192.168.122.1 on virbr0
                             169.254.190.105 on eth0
                             fe80::5054:aa:bbbb:cccc on eth0
                    Gateway: 10.193.11.1 (CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.) on eth0
                        DNS: 8.8.8.8
                             8.8.4.4

       lldp [LINK...]
           Show discovered LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) neighbors. If one or more link names are specified only neighbors on those interfaces are shown.
           Otherwise shows discovered neighbors on all interfaces. Note that for this feature to work, LLDP= must be turned on on the specific interface, see
           systemd.network(5) for details.

           Produces output similar to:

               LINK             CHASSIS ID        SYSTEM NAME      CAPS        PORT ID           PORT DESCRIPTION

               Capability Flags:
               o - Other; p - Repeater;  b - Bridge; w - WLAN Access Point; r - Router;
               t - Telephone; d - DOCSIS cable device; a - Station; c - Customer VLAN;
               s - Service VLAN, m - Two-port MAC Relay (TPMR)

               1 neighbors listed.

       label
           Show numerical address labels that can be used for address selection. This is the same information that ip-addrlabel(8) shows. See RFC 3484[1] for a
           discussion of address labels.

           Produces output similar to:
