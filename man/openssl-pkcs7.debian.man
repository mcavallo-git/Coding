NAME
       openssl-pkcs7, pkcs7 - PKCS#7 utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkcs7 [-help] [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-print_certs] [-text] [-noout] [-engine id]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkcs7 command processes PKCS#7 files in DER or PEM format.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format. DER format is DER encoded PKCS#7 v1.5 structure.PEM (the default) is a base64 encoded version of the DER form with header and footer lines.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.

       -print_certs
           prints out any certificates or CRLs contained in the file. They are preceded by their subject and issuer names in one line format.

       -text
           prints out certificates details in full rather than just subject and issuer names.

       -noout
           don't output the encoded version of the PKCS#7 structure (or certificates is -print_certs is set).

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause pkcs7 to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default for all
           available algorithms.

EXAMPLES
       Convert a PKCS#7 file from PEM to DER:

        openssl pkcs7 -in file.pem -outform DER -out file.der

       Output all certificates in a file:

        openssl pkcs7 -in file.pem -print_certs -out certs.pem

NOTES
       The PEM PKCS#7 format uses the header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN PKCS7-----
        -----END PKCS7-----

       For compatibility with some CAs it will also accept:

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

RESTRICTIONS
       There is no option to print out all the fields of a PKCS#7 file.

       This PKCS#7 routines only understand PKCS#7 v 1.5 as specified in RFC2315 they cannot currently parse, for example, the new CMS as described in RFC2630.
