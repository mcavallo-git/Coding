NAME
       ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

SYNOPSIS
       ping  [-aAbBdDfhLnOqrRUvV46]  [-c count] [-F flowlabel] [-i interval] [-I interface] [-l preload] [-m mark]
       [-M pmtudisc_option] [-N nodeinfo_option] [-w deadline] [-W timeout] [-p pattern] [-Q tos] [-s  packetsize]
       [-S sndbuf] [-t ttl] [-T timestamp option] [hop ...] destination

DESCRIPTION
       ping  uses  the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host
       or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by  a  struct  timeval
       and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.

       ping  works  with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them explicitly can be enforced by specifying -4 or
       -6.

       ping can also send IPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620).  Intermediate hops may not be allowed,  because
       IPv6 source routing was deprecated (RFC5095).

OPTIONS
       -4     Use IPv4 only.

       -6     Use IPv6 only.

       -a     Audible ping.

       -A     Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one
              (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probe is present in the network. Minimal interval is 200msec
              for not super-user.  On networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode.

       -b     Allow pinging a broadcast address.

       -B     Do  not  allow  ping  to change source address of probes.  The address is bound to one selected when
              ping starts.

       -c count
              Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets. With deadline option, ping waits for count ECHO_REPLY
              packets, until the timeout expires.

       -d     Set  the  SO_DEBUG  option on the socket being used.  Essentially, this socket option is not used by
              Linux kernel.

       -D     Print timestamp (unix time + microseconds as in gettimeofday) before each line.

       -f     Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a  period  ``.''  is  printed,  while  for  ever  ECHO_REPLY
              received  a  backspace  is  printed.   This  provides  a rapid display of how many packets are being
              dropped.  If interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets  as  fast  as  they
              come  back  or  one  hundred  times per second, whichever is more.  Only the super-user may use this
              option with zero interval.

       -F flow label
              IPv6 only.  Allocate and set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo request packets.  If value is  zero,
              kernel allocates random flow label.

       -h     Show help.

       -i interval
              Wait  interval  seconds  between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one second between
              each packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval to values  less
              than 0.2 seconds.

       -I interface
              interface  is  either  an address, or an interface name.  If interface is an address, it sets source
              address to specified interface address.  If interface in an interface name, it sets source interface
              to specified interface.  For IPv6, when doing ping to a link-local scope address, link specification
              (by the '%'-notation in destination, or by this option) is required.

       -l preload
              If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets not waiting for reply.   Only  the  super-user
              may select preload more than 3.

       -L     Suppress  loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multi‐
              cast address.

       -m mark
              use mark to tag the packets going out. This is useful for variety of reasons within the kernel  such
              as using policy routing to select specific outbound processing.

       -M pmtudisc_opt
              Select  Path MTU Discovery strategy.  pmtudisc_option may be either do (prohibit fragmentation, even
              local one), want (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or  dont  (do  not
              set DF flag).

       -N nodeinfo_option
              IPv6  only.   Send  ICMPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620), instead of Echo Request.  CAP_NET_RAW
              capability is required.

              help   Show help for NI support.

              name   Queries for Node Names.

              ipv6   Queries for IPv6 Addresses. There are several IPv6 specific flags.

                     ipv6-global
                            Request IPv6 global-scope addresses.

                     ipv6-sitelocal
                            Request IPv6 site-local addresses.

                     ipv6-linklocal
                            Request IPv6 link-local addresses.

                     ipv6-all
                            Request IPv6 addresses on other interfaces.

              ipv4   Queries for IPv4 Addresses.  There is one IPv4 specific flag.

                     ipv4-all
                            Request IPv4 addresses on other interfaces.

              subject-ipv6=ipv6addr
                     IPv6 subject address.

              subject-ipv4=ipv4addr
                     IPv4 subject address.

              subject-name=nodename
                     Subject name.  If it contains more than one dot, fully-qualified domain name is assumed.

              subject-fqdn=nodename
                     Subject name.  Fully-qualified domain name is always assumed.

       -n     Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.

       -O     Report outstanding ICMP ECHO reply before sending next packet.  This is  useful  together  with  the
              timestamp -D to log output to a diagnostic file and search for missing answers.

       -p pattern
              You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you send.  This is useful for diagnos‐
              ing data-dependent problems in a network.  For example, -p ff will  cause  the  sent  packet  to  be
              filled with all ones.

       -q     Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

       -Q tos Set  Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams.  tos can be decimal (ping only) or hex num‐
              ber.

              In RFC2474, these fields are interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of:  bits
              0-1 (2 lowest bits) of separate data, and bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated Services Code‐
              point (DSCP).  In RFC2481 and RFC3168, bits 0-1 are used for ECN.

              Historically (RFC1349, obsoleted by RFC2474), these were interpreted as:  bit  0  (lowest  bit)  for
              reserved  (currently  being  redefined  as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and bits 5-7
              (highest bits) for Precedence.

       -r     Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached interface.  If the  host
              is  not  on  a  directly-attached  network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a
              local host through an interface that has no route through it provided the option -I is also used.

       -R     ping only.  Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and  displays
              the  route  buffer  on returned packets.  Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such
              routes.  Many hosts ignore or discard this option.

       -s packetsize
              Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56, which  translates  into  64  ICMP
              data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

       -S sndbuf
              Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet.

       -t ttl ping only.  Set the IP Time to Live.

       -T timestamp option
              Set  special  IP  timestamp options.  timestamp option may be either tsonly (only timestamps), tsan‐
              daddr (timestamps and addresses) or tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp  prespecified
              hops).

       -U     Print  full  user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally ping prints network round trip time,
              which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.

       -v     Verbose output.

       -V     Show version and exit.

       -w deadline
              Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have  been  sent  or
              received.  In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline
              expire or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from network.

       -W timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in  seconds.  The  option  affects  only  timeout  in  absence  of  any
              responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.

       When  using  ping  for  fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify that the local
       network interface is up and  running.  Then,  hosts  and  gateways  further  and  further  away  should  be
       ``pinged''.  Round-trip  times and packet loss statistics are computed.  If duplicate packets are received,
       they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
       in  calculating  the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers.  When the specified number of packets
       have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is  displayed.
       Shorter current statistics can be obtained without termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.

       If  ping does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1. If a packet count and deadline
       are both specified, and fewer than count packets are received by the time the deadline has arrived, it will
       also  exit with code 1.  On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it
       possible to use the exit code to see if a host is alive or not.

       This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management.  Because of  the  load  it
       can impose on the network, it is unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.

ICMP PACKET DETAILS
       An IP header without options is 20 bytes.  An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth
       of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.  When a packetsize is  given,  this  indicated  the
       size  of  this  extra  piece  of data (the default is 56). Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP
       packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the ICMP header).

       If the data space is at least of size of struct timeval ping uses the beginning  bytes  of  this  space  to
       include a timestamp which it uses in the computation of round trip times.  If the data space is shorter, no
       round trip times are given.

DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
       ping will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate packets should  never  occur,  and  seem  to  be
       caused by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely
       (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.

       Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere  in  the
       ping packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).

TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
       The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data contained in the data
       portion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks  and  remain  unde‐
       tected for long periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
       that doesn't have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all ones or all zeros, or  a  pattern  right  at  the
       edge,  such  as  almost all zeros.  It isn't necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for
       example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data  link  level,  and  the
       relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated.

       This  means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of testing to find
       it.  If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either can't be sent across your network or  that
       takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can then examine this file for repeated
       patterns that you can test using the -p option of ping.

TTL DETAILS
       The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet  can  go  through
       before  being thrown away.  In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the
       TTL field by exactly one.

       The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for TCP packets should be set to 60,  but  many  systems
       use smaller values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).

       The  maximum  possible  value  of  this  field  is  255,  and  most  Unix systems set the TTL field of ICMP
       ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.  This is why you will find you can ``ping'' some hosts,  but  not  reach  them
       with telnet(1) or ftp(1).

       In normal operation ping prints the TTL value from the packet it receives.  When a remote system receives a
       ping packet, it can do one of three things with the TTL field in its response:

       · Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix systems did before the 4.3BSD Tahoe release. In this  case  the
         TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path.

       · Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley Unix systems do.  In this case the TTL value in the received
         packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the path from the remote system to the pinging host.

       · Set it to some other value. Some machines use the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP pack‐
         ets, for example either 30 or 60.  Others may use completely wild values.

BUGS
       · Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.

       · The maximum IP header length is too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful.  There's
         not much that can be done about this, however.

       · Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the broadcast address should only be  done
         under very controlled conditions.

HISTORY
       The ping command appeared in 4.3BSD.

       The version described here is its descendant specific to Linux.

       As  of version s20150815, the ping6 binary doesn't exist anymore.  It has been merged into ping. Creating a
       symlink named ping6 pointing to ping will result in the same funcionality as before.

SECURITY
       ping requires CAP_NET_RAW capability to be executed 1) if the program is used for non-echo queries (See  -N
       option),  or 2) if kernel does not support non-raw ICMP sockets, or 3) if the user is not allowed to create
       an ICMP echo socket.  The program may be used as set-uid root.

AVAILABILITY
       ping  is  part  of  iputils  package  and  the  latest  versions  are   available   in   source   form   at
       http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.
