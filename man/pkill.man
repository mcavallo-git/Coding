PGREP(1)                                           User Commands                                          PGREP(1)

NAME
       pgrep, pkill - look up or signal processes based on name and other attributes

SYNOPSIS
       pgrep [options] pattern
       pkill [options] pattern

DESCRIPTION
       pgrep  looks  through  the  currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection
       criteria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example,

              $ pgrep -u root sshd

       will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand,

              $ pgrep -u root,daemon

       will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.

       pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them  on  std‐
       out.

OPTIONS
       -signal
       --signal signal
              Defines  the signal to send to each matched process.  Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name
              can be used.  (pkill only.)

       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.  When count does not match any‐
              thing, e.g. returns zero, the command will return non-zero value.

       -d, --delimiter delimiter
              Sets the string used to delimit each process ID in the output (by default a newline).  (pgrep only.)

       -f, --full
              The  pattern  is  normally  only matched against the process name.  When -f is set, the full command
              line is used.

       -g, --pgroup pgrp,...
              Only match processes in the process group IDs listed.  Process group 0 is translated into pgrep's or
              pkill's own process group.

       -G, --group gid,...
              Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be
              used.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Match processes case-insensitively.

       -l, --list-name
              List the process name as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.)

       -a, --list-full
              List the full command line as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.)

       -n, --newest
              Select only the newest (most recently started) of the matching processes.

       -o, --oldest
              Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the matching processes.

       -P, --parent ppid,...
              Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.

       -s, --session sid,...
              Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.  Session ID 0 is translated into pgrep's or
              pkill's own session ID.

       -t, --terminal term,...
              Only  match  processes  whose controlling terminal is listed.  The terminal name should be specified
              without the "/dev/" prefix.

       -u, --euid euid,...
              Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.  Either the numerical  or  symbolical  value
              may be used.

       -U, --uid uid,...
              Only  match processes whose real user ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be
              used.

       -v, --inverse
              Negates the matching.  This option is usually used in pgrep's context.  In pkill's context the short
              option is disabled to avoid accidental usage of the option.

       -w, --lightweight
              Shows  all  thread  ids  instead of pids in pgrep's context.  In pkill's context this option is dis‐
              abled.

       -x, --exact
              Only match processes whose names (or command line if -f is specified) exactly match the pattern.

       -F, --pidfile file
              Read PID's from file.  This option is perhaps more useful for pkill than pgrep.

       -L, --logpidfile
              Fail if pidfile (see -F) not locked.

       --ns pid
              Match processes that belong to the same namespaces. Required to run as root to match processes  from
              other users. See --nslist for how to limit which namespaces to match.

       --nslist name,...
              Match only the provided namespaces. Available namespaces: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user,uts.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

OPERANDS
       pattern
              Specifies an Extended Regular Expression for matching against the process names or command lines.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: Find the process ID of the named daemon:

              $ pgrep -u root named

       Example 2: Make syslog reread its configuration file:

              $ pkill -HUP syslogd

       Example 3: Give detailed information on all xterm processes:

              $ ps -fp $(pgrep -d, -x xterm)

       Example 4: Make all netscape processes run nicer:

              $ renice +4 $(pgrep netscape)

EXIT STATUS
       0      One or more processes matched the criteria.
       1      No processes matched.
       2      Syntax error in the command line.
       3      Fatal error: out of memory etc.

NOTES
       The process name used for matching is limited to the 15 characters present in the output of /proc/pid/stat.
       Use the -f option to match against the complete command line, /proc/pid/cmdline.

       The running pgrep or pkill process will never report itself as a match.

BUGS
       The options -n and -o and -v can not be combined.  Let me know if you need to do this.

       Defunct processes are reported.
