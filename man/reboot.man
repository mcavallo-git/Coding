DESCRIPTION
       halt, poweroff, reboot may be used to halt, power-off or reboot the machine.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --halt
           Halt the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

       -p, --poweroff
           Power-off the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

       --reboot
           Reboot the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

       -f, --force
           Force immediate halt, power-off, or reboot. When specified once, this results in an immediate but clean shutdown by the system manager. When
           specified twice, this results in an immediate shutdown without contacting the system manager. See the description of --force in systemctl(1)
           for more details.

       -w, --wtmp-only
           Only write wtmp shutdown entry, do not actually halt, power-off, reboot.

       -d, --no-wtmp
           Do not write wtmp shutdown entry.

       -n, --no-sync
           Don't sync hard disks/storage media before halt, power-off, reboot.

       --no-wall
           Do not send wall message before halt, power-off, reboot.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

NOTES
       These commands are implemented in a way that preserves compatiblity with the original SysV commands.  systemctl(1) verbs halt, poweroff, reboot
       provide the same functionality with some additional features.
