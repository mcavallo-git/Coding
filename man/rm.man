RM(1)                                               User Commands                                               RM(1)

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not
       remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more  than  three  files  or  the  -r,  -R,  or
       --recursive  are  given,  then  rm  prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is  not  given,
       or the -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively;  less  intrusive  than
              -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that
              of the corresponding command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or  -R)  option  to  remove  each  listed
       directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that  if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given suffi‐
       cient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider  using
       shred.
