NAME
       seq - print a sequence of numbers

SYNOPSIS
       seq [OPTION]... LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST

DESCRIPTION
       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST  or  INCREMENT  is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when
       LAST is smaller than FIRST.  The sequence of numbers ends when the sum of the  current  number  and  INCREMENT
       would  become greater than LAST.  FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating point values.  INCRE‐
       MENT is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is  greater
       than  LAST.   INCREMENT  must not be 0; none of FIRST, INCREMENT and LAST may be NaN.  FORMAT must be suitable
       for printing one argument of type 'double'; it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed
       point decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise.
