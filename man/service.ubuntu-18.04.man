SERVICE(8)                                    System Manager's Manual                                   SERVICE(8)

NAME
       service - run a System V init script

SYNOPSIS
       service SCRIPT COMMAND [OPTIONS]

       service --status-all

       service --help | -h | --version

DESCRIPTION
       service  runs a System V init script or systemd unit in as predictable an environment as possible, removing
       most environment variables and with the current working directory set to /.

       The SCRIPT parameter specifies a System V init script, located in /etc/init.d/SCRIPT, or the name of a sys‚Äê
       temd  unit. The existence of a systemd unit of the same name as a script in /etc/init.d will cause the unit
       to take precedence over the init.d script.  The supported values of COMMAND depend on the  invoked  script.
       service  passes COMMAND  and OPTIONS to the init script unmodified. For systemd units, start, stop, status,
       and reload are passed through to their systemctl/initctl equivalents.

       All scripts should support at least the start and  stop  commands.   As  a  special  case,  if  COMMAND  is
       --full-restart, the script is run twice, first with the stop command, then with the start command.

       service --status-all runs all init scripts, in alphabetical order, with the status command. The status is [
       + ] for running services, [ - ] for stopped services and [ ? ] for services without a status command.  This
       option only calls status for sysvinit jobs.

EXIT CODES
       service calls the init script and returns the status returned by it.

              The directory containing System V init scripts.
