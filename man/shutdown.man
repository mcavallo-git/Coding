SHUTDOWN(8)                                                              shutdown                                                              SHUTDOWN(8)

NAME
       shutdown - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine

SYNOPSIS
       shutdown [OPTIONS...] [TIME] [WALL...]

DESCRIPTION
       shutdown may be used to halt, power-off or reboot the machine.

       The first argument may be a time string (which is usually "now"). Optionally, this may be followed by a wall message to be sent to all logged-in
       users before going down.

       The time string may either be in the format "hh:mm" for hour/minutes specifying the time to execute the shutdown at, specified in 24h clock format.
       Alternatively it may be in the syntax "+m" referring to the specified number of minutes m from now.  "now" is an alias for "+0", i.e. for
       triggering an immediate shutdown. If no time argument is specified, "+1" is implied.

       Note that to specify a wall message you must specify a time argument, too.

       If the time argument is used, 5 minutes before the system goes down the /run/nologin file is created to ensure that further logins shall not be
       allowed.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       -H, --halt
           Halt the machine.

       -P, --poweroff
           Power-off the machine (the default).

       -r, --reboot
           Reboot the machine.

       -h
           Equivalent to --poweroff, unless --halt is specified.

       -k
           Do not halt, power-off, reboot, just write wall message.

       --no-wall
           Do not send wall message before halt, power-off, reboot.

       -c
           Cancel a pending shutdown. This may be used cancel the effect of an invocation of shutdown with a time argument that is not "+0" or "now".
