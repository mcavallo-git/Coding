NAME
       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

SYNOPSIS
       tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.

       -a, --append
              append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite

       -i, --ignore-interrupts
              ignore interrupt signals

       -p     diagnose errors writing to non pipes

       --output-error[=MODE]
              set behavior on write error.  See MODE below

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   MODE determines behavior with write errors on the outputs:
       'warn' diagnose errors writing to any output

       'warn-nopipe'
              diagnose errors writing to any output not a pipe

       'exit' exit on error writing to any output

       'exit-nopipe'
              exit on error writing to any output not a pipe

       The  default  MODE for the -p option is 'warn-nopipe'.  The default operation when --output-error is not specified, is to exit immediately on error
       writing to a pipe, and diagnose errors writing to non pipe outputs.
