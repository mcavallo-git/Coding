NAME
       uniq - report or omit repeated lines

SYNOPSIS
       uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

DESCRIPTION
       Filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input), writing to OUTPUT (or standard output).

       With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences

       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines, one for each group

       -D     print all duplicate lines

       --all-repeated[=METHOD]
              like -D, but allow separating groups with an empty line; METHOD={none(default),prepend,separate}

       -f, --skip-fields=N
              avoid comparing the first N fields

       --group[=METHOD]
              show all items, separating groups with an empty line; METHOD={separate(default),prepend,append,both}

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore differences in case when comparing

       -s, --skip-chars=N
              avoid comparing the first N characters

       -u, --unique
              only print unique lines

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       -w, --check-chars=N
              compare no more than N characters in lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       A  field  is  a  run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs), then non-blank characters.  Fields are skipped
       before chars.

       Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.  You  may  want  to  sort  the  input
       first, or use 'sort -u' without 'uniq'.  Also, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.
