# Upgrading the Antenna(s) on `T-Mobile`'s `5G Gateway`

<!-- ------------------------------ -->

***
## Step 0. Preface
>&nbsp;
> `T-Mobile`'s `Home Internet` service currently uses the `Sagemcom Fast 5688W` for the client-side `5G Gateway` modem-router.
>&nbsp;
> The `Sagemcom Fast 5688W` has `four` internal `U.FL` ports, which allow for `two` `2x2 MIMO antennas` or `one` `4x4 MIMO antenna` to be connected to the device. [- Waveform](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-sagemcom)
>&nbsp;
> ‚≠ê A `4x4 MIMO antenna` offers superior performance and would allow more of the internal cellular antenna ports to be used than a `2x2 MIMO antenna`. [- Waveform](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-sagemcom)

## Step 1. Hardware Selection
- Select the configuration (below) which is best suited to the needs of your deployment scenario (based on the performance/reliability needs, budget constraints, etc.)
  ***
  ### Configuration #1 - `One` `4x4 MIMO Antenna`
  > üëç Most effective
  - Required hardware:

  > ‚ùåÔ∏è Least effective
  - Required hardware:
    - Antenna(s): `One (1)` * [`2x2 MIMO Panel Antenna by Waveform @ $99.99 ea.`](https://amazon.com/dp/B09CLV3BHJ)
    - Adapter(s): `Two (2)` * [`U.FL to SMA-Female adapter @ ~$1.49 ea.`](https://amazon.com/s?k=SMA-Female+to+U.FL+pigtail+connectors)
    - Cable(s): `Two (2)` * [`SMA Male to SMA Male Cable @ ~$14.99 ea.`](https://amazon.com/s?k=SMA+Male+to+SMA+Male+Cable)

## Step 2. Hardware Purchasing/Acquisition
- Once you have made your selection, purchase or acquire (by other means) the `required hardware` for your selected configuration
  - Once all the `required hardware` is acquired and ready to install, continue on to the next step of this guide

<!-- ------------------------------ -->

***
## Step 3. Convert the `5G Gateway`'s internal `U.FL` ports to external `SMA` ports
- For the following items, refer to section [`"Installing External Antennas to the T-Mobile 5G Internet Gateway" of the Waveform guide`](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-sagemcom#installing-external-antennas-to-the-t-mobile-5g-internet-gateway) for detailed instructions on:
  1. Teardown the `5G Gateway` enclosure
  2. Disconnect the `5G Gateway`'s internal `U.FL` cables
      - Internal `U.FL` cable's color/position designations:
        - `5GNR P`: `Red` cable / `Leftmost` `U.FL` port
        - `LTE D`: `Green` cable / `Second from the left` `U.FL` port
        - `MIMO 1`: `Orange` cable / `Second from the right` `U.FL` port
        - `LTE M`: `Blue` cable / `Rightmost` `U.FL` port
      - Internal `U.FL` ports to disconnect:
        - If you have a `4x4 MIMO antenna`:
          - Disconnect the `Red`, `Green`, `Orange` & `Blue` cables.
        - If you have a `2x2 MIMO antenna`:
          - If `5G cell service` IS available ‚úîÔ∏è at your location:
            - Disconnect the `Red` & `Orange` cables.
          - If `5G cell service` is NOT available ‚ùåÔ∏è at your location:
            - Disconnect the `Green` & `Blue` cables.
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to wrap disconnected/unused internal `U.FL` cables with electrical tape & move them to the side of the inner enclosure
        - <sub>*These disconnected/unused `U.FL` cables run to the internal `MIMO antennas` and should be taken care of, as they will help to avoid additional ISP charges down the road (so long as they aren't damaged and the `5G Gateway`'s antennas work as intended) if the `5G Gateway` ever needs to be returned to the `5G Gateway`'s respective ISP (such as `T-Mobile`)*</sub>
  3. Attach & route `U.FL` to `SMA` adapters to the `5G Gateway`
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to route the cables from internal to external using the proper holes/gaps in the encloure
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to label each external `SMA` port with the exact same label of it's associated (internal) `U.FL` port
  4. Reassemble the `5G Gateway` enclosure
    - Upon closing the `5G Gateway` back up, it should look the same as before you opened it, albeit for the handful of well-labelled `SMA` female ports which are now coming out of it

***
## Step 4. Connect the `5G Gateway` to the `MIMO antenna`
  - Once all desired `SMA` adapters are ran to the outside of the `5G Gateway` enclosure and the enclosure is reassembled and closed up:
    - Connect your antenna(s) to the now-external `SMA` ports on the `5G Gateway`
      - Requires (mentioned above) 1 * [SMA Male to SMA Male Cable](https://amazon.com/s?k=SMA+Male+to+SMA+Male+Cable) to connect each `MIMO Antenna` `SMA` port to each `5G Gateway` `SMA` port
    - **`Gateway`-to-`Antenna` `SMA` ordering/pairing**
      - Determining which `SMA` ports on the `5G Gateway` should be connected to which `SMA` ports on the `MIMO Antenna` may require some trial and error for your exact use case scenario:
        - For `Nader Tater`'s ordering suggestions, refer to the [YouTube video `External Waveform Antenna Test`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA0W1XRU4J8&t=1210s)
        - For `Waveform`'s ordering suggestions, refer to [their `External Antenna` guide](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-sagemcom)
          - Search for "`in the order`" to skip to the `Gateway`-to-`Antenna` ordering section of the guide

***
## Step 5. Position, Aim & Mount the `MIMO antenna(s)`
- For general positioning & aiming tips, refer to section [`"Positioning and Aiming MIMO Antennas" of the Waveform guide`](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-sagemcom#positioning-and-aiming-mimo-antennas):
  - > &nbsp;
    > The goal is to find the best location and direction for the antenna(s), to maximize data rates to the T-Mobile Gateway.
    > &nbsp;
    > Once you've found the position which gets you the highest data rates to the T-Mobile Gateway, that's where you'll want to install the MIMO antenna.
