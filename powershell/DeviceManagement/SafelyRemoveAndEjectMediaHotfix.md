## I solved the issue of improper devices showing up under `Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media` in the taskbar via the following:

- ### [`SetDeviceProperties_NonRemovableFingerprintScanners.verbose.ps1`](https://github.com/mcavallo-git/Coding/blob/main/powershell/DeviceManagement/SetDeviceProperties_NonRemovableFingerprintScanners.verbose.ps1#L8-L89)

  > I just finished writing/testing this script, and put it on my public GitHub for external reference - Use it as you wish (but I would recommend at least reading the next two notes for a bit of prefacing)

  > I added a variables `$PnP_Class` and `$PnP_FriendlyName` to the top of the script to make it easier to target other types of devices which shouldn't be removable/ejectable

- ### [`SetDeviceProperties_NonRemovableFingerprintScanners.ps1`](https://github.com/mcavallo-git/Coding/blob/main/powershell/DeviceManagement/SetDeviceProperties_NonRemovableFingerprintScanners.ps1#L4-L31)

  > This is a thinned down version of the above script which I run against using Task Scheduler (not directly out of my GitHub)

  > For simplified copy-paste, I write a lot of scripts wrapped in a large outer `If ($True) { ... }` block, so that you can just copy that whole outer `If` block and not worry about losing this or that or certain lines running without others when pasting into a terminal üëç

> Here's a general workflow for the above script(s)...

1. Use PowerShell's [`Get-PnpDevice`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pnpdevice/get-pnpdevice) cmdlet to target the device(s) you wish to no longer show as removable/ejectable media. For each `PnpDevice` acquired:

2. Append the device's `InstanceId` property onto the static USB devices registry path, such as: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\${InstanceId}`

3. Perform a [`Bitwise AND`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_arithmetic_operators?view=powershell-7.3#bitwise-operators) (`-band`) between the device's `Capability` value and each of the undesired capabilities (namely [`CM_DEVCAP_EJECTSUPPORTED`](https://github.com/tpn/winsdk-10/blob/master/Include/10.0.10240.0/um/cfgmgr32.h#L1067-L1076) (`0x2`) and [`CM_DEVCAP_REMOVABLE`](https://github.com/tpn/winsdk-10/blob/master/Include/10.0.10240.0/um/cfgmgr32.h#L1067-L1076) (`0x4`)), then subtract the resultant value coming out of the `-band` from the `Capability` value.

    - If the `Capability` value *DID* contain either `0x2` or `0x4`, then the `-band` resultant value will contain the exact differential to subtract off of the `Capability` to remove only the functionality which isnt needed.

    - If the `Capability` value *DIDN'T* contain either `0x2` or `0x4`, then the `-band` will result in a value of `0`, and we will subtract nothing (e.g. no changes to be made)

      - The above script also takes this final subtracted value and compares it against the original `Capability` value to see if it actually should perform a registry update (and skips it if not)

4. Repeat step 2 & 3 for each device's parent device (and its associated `InstanceId`)
    - > ‚ö†Ô∏è This was the kicker that, once solved for, finally made things work for me - I had a USB hub between the device and my computer which had a capability of `0x84` (which contains `0x4`), and was causing the device to still show up as removable/ejectable even though the device itself had its `Capability` value set as intended
    - Use PowerShell's [`Get-PnpDeviceProperty`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pnpdevice/get-pnpdeviceproperty) cmdlet targeting each device (from step 2)'s `InstanceId` along with the KeyName [`DEVPKEY_Device_Parent`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/devpkey-device-parent) and expand the property `Data` (from the returned object)
      - This `Data` field will yield the `InstanceId` of the parent element (such as a USB dock), which requires performing steps 2 & 3 for in the same manner as the original device itself

Hope this helps!
