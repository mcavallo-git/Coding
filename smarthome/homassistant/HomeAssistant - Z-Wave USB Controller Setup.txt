- Attaching a Z-Wave USB controller (device/key) to HomeAssistant
   |
   |
   |--> Plug in your Z-Wave USB device into the computer running HomeAssistant
   |
   |
   |--> Browse to the HomeAssistant Portal's URL
   |     |--> In your web browser, browse to the HomeAssistant portal @ the IPv4 address of HomeAssistant, using port 8123 (http://HOMEASSISTANT_FQDN:8123)
   |
   |
   |--> Get the Z-Wave USB device's "Device Path"
   |      |--> In the HomeAssistant portal select "Supervisor" > "System" > "︙" > "Hardware"
   |      |--> Locate the USB device/key's name or ID (such as ttyAMA0 or ttyACM0)
   |      |--> Dropdown the usb device & copy the value next to "Device path" (such as "/dev/ttyUSB0" or "/dev/ttyACM0")
   |
   |
   |--> Install the "Check Home Assistant configuration" Add-on
   |     |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Add-on Store" > Search for "Check Home Assistant configuration" > "Install"
   |     |--> Configure the Add-on (once installed)
   |           |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Dashboard" > "Check Home Assistant configuration"
   |           |--> Enable "Start on boot"
   |           |--> Enable "Show in sidebar"
   |
   |
   |--> Install the "File editor" Add-on
   |     |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Add-on Store" > Search for "File editor" > "Install"
   |     |--> Configure the Add-on (once installed)
   |     |     |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Dashboard" > "File editor"
   |     |     |--> Enable "Start on boot"
   |     |     |--> Enable "Show in sidebar"
   |     |
   |     |--> Check the configuration via "Configuration" > "Server Controls" (near bottom) > "Check Configration"
   |
   |--> Update the HomeAssistant config with your Z-Wave USB Device's "Device path" value
   |     |--> Open "File editor" Add-on via sidebar option "File editor" (or "Supervisor" > "Dashboard" > "File editor" > "Open Web UI")
	 |           |--> Open "/config/configuration.yaml" & add the following code to the bottom of the file:
zwave:
 usb_path: /dev/ttyACM0
   |     |--> NOTE: Replace the value of "/dev/ttyUSB0" with the "Device path" value from above (on the system hardware page)
   |     |--> Save the file via the [ Red floppy save icon ]
   |     |--> Validate the configuration via "Configuration" > "Server Controls" > "Check Configration"
   |
   |
   |--> Install the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" Supervisor Add-on
   |     |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Add-on Store" > Search for "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" > "Install"
   |     |--> Configure the Add-on (once installed)
   |     |     |--> Click "Supervisor" > "Dashboard" > "Z-Wave JS to MQTT"
   |     |     |--> Enable "Start on boot"
   |     |     |--> Enable "Watchdog"
   |     |     |--> Enable "Show in sidebar"
   |     |
   |     |--> NOTE: If you already have secure Z-Wave devices paired with another Z-Wave Integration/Add-on, get the Network path of said key it from "/config/.storage/core.config_entries", then disable said (separate) Z-Wave Integration/Add-on & restart the HomeAssistant host (requried to 'release' the USB Z-Wave device/key from other Integrations/Add-ons) - Reference: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-z-wave-network-key/184322
   |
   |
   |--> Restart the HomeAssistant host to apply changes to "/config/configuration.yaml" and complete the installation of the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" Supervisor Add-on
   |     |--> "Supervisor" > "System" > "Reboot Host"
   |
   |
   |--> Open "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" via sidebar option "Z-Wave JS" (or "Supervisor" > "Dashboard" > "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" > "Open Web UI")
         |
         |--> Add Z-Wave controller (Z-Wave USB Stick)
         |     |--> Add your Z-Wave controller (USB device/key) using the initial Add-on's dropdown menus (make sure to select the intended "USB Device Path" as found earlier under "Supervisor" > "System" > "︙" > "Hardware")
         |
         |--> Add Z-Wave nodes (Z-Wave Inclusion)
         |      |--> "Z-Wave JS" > "Actions" > "Add/Remove Device" > "Inclusion" (or "Secure Inclusion" for locks & door openers) > "Start" > [perform inclusion action/steps on target device (refer to specific device's manual) to include it onto the network]
         |
         |--> Remove Z-Wave nodes (Z-Wave Exclusion)
                |--> "Z-Wave JS" > "Actions" > "Add/Remove Device" > "Exclusion" > "Start" > [perform exclusion action/steps on target device (refer to specific device's manual) to exclude it from the network]
