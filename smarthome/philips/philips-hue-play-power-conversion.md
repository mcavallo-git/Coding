# Philips Hue Play - Making a more reliable power connection than the stock barrel connector
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->

***
## Main Issue
- The barrel connectors that come with Philips Hue's "Play" line of devices disconnect easily when twisted in their port, even if touched gently.
- This includes (but is not limited to) the following device(s):
  - [`Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-gradient-lightstrip-65-inch/046677560416) 
  - [`Philips Hue Play Light Bar`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-light-bar-single-pack/7820131U7)
  - [`Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221)

## Generalized Solution #1 (no cutting cables)
  - Item #1: `24V` Power Supply outputting at least `2A` via a male `5.5mm` x `2.5mm` barrel connector
  - Item #2: Barrel connector splitter, 1 * male `5.5mm` x `2.5mm` to 4 * female `5.5mm` x `2.5mm`
  - Item #3: 4 * Barrel connector adapter, female `5.5mm` x `2.5mm` to female `6.5mm` x `3.0mm`
  - Note(s):
  > - The `6.5mm` x `3.0mm` `barrel connector` is a rare type of termination, and finding cables/adapters to match it may be difficult

## Generalized Solution #2 (w/ cutting cables)
