# Philips Hue Play - Making a more reliable power connection than the stock barrel connector
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->

***
## Main Issue
- The barrel connectors that come with Philips Hue's "Play" line of devices disconnect easily when twisted in their port, even if touched gently.
- This includes (but is not limited to) the following device(s):
  - [`Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-gradient-lightstrip-65-inch/046677560416) 
  - [`Philips Hue Play Light Bar`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-light-bar-single-pack/7820131U7)
  - [`Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221)
