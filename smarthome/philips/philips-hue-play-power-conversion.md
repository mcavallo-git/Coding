# Philips Hue Play - Making a more reliable power connection than the stock barrel connector
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->

***
## Main Issue
- The barrel connectors that come with Philips Hue's "Play" line of devices disconnect easily when twisted in their port, even if touched gently.
- This includes (but is not limited to) the following device(s):
  - [`Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-gradient-lightstrip-65-inch/046677560416) 
  - [`Philips Hue Play Light Bar`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-light-bar-single-pack/7820131U7)
  - [`Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box`](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221)

- Note(s):
> - The `6.5mm` x `3.0mm` `barrel connector` is a rare type of termination, and finding cables/adapters to match it may be difficult
> - The Hue Play devices have a `male` barrel connector on the end of their cable (coming from the device)
>   - This is in opposition to traditional devices, which have a `male` barrel connector coming from the power supply, which plugs into a `female` port on the device
> - The Hue Play power supplies have either `1` or `3` `female` barrel connector ports
