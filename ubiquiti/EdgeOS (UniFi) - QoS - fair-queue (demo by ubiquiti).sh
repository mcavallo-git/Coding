# EdgeOS - Fair Queue (QoS)
#
#   The fair queue policy uses the Stochastic Fairness Queueing approach to separate traffic
#     flows (for example, TCP connections) into different buckets and have the router service each bucket one by one.
#
#   The separation is done using a hash of the source/destination IP addresses and the source port.
#
#   Probabilistically this allows the router to fairly service different traffic flows.
#
#
#   The fair queue policy can only be applied to the out direction.
#
#   Since the fairness is probabilistic, in some cases multiple flows may be put into the same bucket; this can potentially cause unfairness.
#
#   To minimize effects, you can adjust the hash interval parameter to change the hashing algorithm at fixed time intervals.
#


#   This is an example of a fair queue policy:
configure
set traffic-policy fair-queue fair1 hash-interval 10
set interfaces ethernet eth0 traffic-policy out fair1
commit ; save
exit


#
# Note:
#   The interface mentioned in this example is eth0 (WAN).
#
#   When a PPPoE interface is used for WAN, the policy should be applied to pppoeX rather than the Ethernet interface.
#
#   For EdgeRouter modules that include a switch interface, the traffic policy will need to be
#     applied to the switch interface (switch0) rather than the single Ethernet interface (eth1).
