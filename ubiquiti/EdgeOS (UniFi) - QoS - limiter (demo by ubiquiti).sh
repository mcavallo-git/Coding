# EdgeOS - Limiter (QoS)
#
#   The limiter policy performs ingress policing and therefore can only be applied to the in direction of traffic on a network interface.
#
#   You can define multiple classes of traffic, and you can apply a separate bandwidth limit to each class.
#
#   For example, the following policy set a limit of 1 Mbps for incoming ICMP traffic on eth0 and a limit of 10 Mbps for the other traffic.
#


configure
set traffic-­policy limiter limit1 class 1 bandwidth 1mbit
set traffic-­policy limiter limit1 class 1 match match1 ip protocol icmp
set traffic-­policy limiter limit1 default bandwidth 10mbit
set interfaces ethernet eth0 traffic­policy in limit1

#
# Note (1):
#   The limiter policy is designed for traffic destined for the router itself, and the policing
#     behavior is less accurate when it is applied to traffic that is going through the router.
#
#   One possible workaround for this is to create an input interface, to which any outbound policies can be then applied.
#
# Note (2):
#   The interface mentioned in this example is eth0 (WAN).
#
#   When a PPPoE interface is used for WAN, the policy should be applied to pppoeX rather than the Ethernet interface.
#
#   For EdgeRouter modules that include a switch interface, the traffic policy will need to be
#     applied to the switch interface (switch0) rather than the single Ethernet interface (eth1).
