# EdgeOS - Shaper (QoS)
#
#   A more complicated policy is the shaper policy, which uses the Hierarchical Token Bucket
#     technique to provide different bandwidth guarantees to different classes of traffic on a network link.
#
#   A simple example is shown below.
#

configure
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 bandwidth 100mbit
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 default bandwidth 60mbit
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 class 2 bandwidth 20mbit
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 class 2 match client2 ip source address 10.0.1.2/32
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 class 3 bandwidth 20mbit
set traffic­policy shaper shaper1 class 3 match client3 ip source address 10.0.1.3/32
set interfaces ethernet eth0 traffic­policy out shaper1
commit


#
#   In this example, a shaper policy shaper1 is defined and applied to the out direction on interface eth0, which has 100 Mbps bandwidth.
#
#   Two classes of traffic are defined, one for traffic originating from IP address 10.0.1.2
#     and the other for traffic origination from IP address 10.0.1.3.
#
#   Each of the two classes is guaranteed 20 Mbps of bandwidth for its traffic, meaning
#     that when under load it guarantees that bandwidth, but can exceed it if there is availability.
#
#   All other traffic falls into the default class with 60 Mbps reserved bandwidth.
#
#   So, for example, if the current outgoing traffic on eth0 includes:
#     20 Mbps from IP 10.0.1.2,
#     20 Mbps from IP 10.0.1.3, and
#     80 Mbps from other sources,
#   the traffic from IP 10.0.1.2 and IP 10.0.1.3 will be sent out at their full rates since
#   they are each guaranteed 20 Mbps, and the other traffic will only be sent out at 60 Mbps.
#
# Note:
#
#   The interface mentioned in this example is eth0 (WAN).
#
#   When a PPPoE interface is used for WAN, the policy should be applied to pppoeX rather than the Ethernet interface.
#
#   For EdgeRouter modules that include a switch interface, the traffic policy will need
#     to be applied to the switch interface (switch0) rather than the single Ethernet interface (eth1).

# EdgeRouter - Traffic Policies (Shaper) for Upload, Download and VoIP (QoS)
#
#   The following example uses two traffic policies (one for upload, one for
#     download) to limit client 10.0.3.2 to an upload rate of 512Kbps (allowing bursts to 640Kbps)
#     and downloads of 1Mbit (allowing bursts to 1.5Mbit if the bandwidth is available).
