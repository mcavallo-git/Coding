Description
===========

ShellMenuView is a small utility that display the list of static menu
items that appeared in the context menu when you right-click a
file/folder on Windows Explorer, and allows you to easily disable
unwanted menu items.



System Requirements
===================

ShellMenuView works properly on any version of Windows starting from
Windows 2000 and up to Windows 10. You can also use ShellMenuView on
Windows 98 for viewing the menu items list, but the disable/enable
feature won't work on this version of Windows. (The disabling feature is
achieved by adding 'LegacyDisable' key to the desired menu item in the
Registry, and this Registry key is not supported by Windows 98)



Versions History
================


* Version 1.30
  o Fixed the extension column: For Menu items that are currently not
    assigned to any file extension, the extension column now remains
    empty.
  o Added 'UserChoice Key' column. If the value is 'Yes', it means
    that the reference to the menu item is found in

* Version 1.25

    extension has a UserChoice key (Windows Vista or later). In previous
    versions, ShellMenuView failed to work properly with all file

    type. The UserChoice key is stored under

    sorting, by holding down the shift key while clicking the column
    header. Be aware that you only have to hold down the shift key when

    should not hold down the Shift key.

Using ShellMenuView
===================

ShellMenuView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLLs. In order to start using it, just copy the executable file
(shmnview.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
The main window of ShellMenuView displays the list of menu items. You can
select one or more menu item, and enable/disable them.
You can also set or remove the extended mode of menu item. When menu item
is in extended mode, the item is displayed only if you press the Shift
key when the context menu is opened.

This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting

The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Menu Key" and "File Type". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~Modified Time") if you want to sort in descending order. You can
put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
shmnview.exe /shtml "f:\temp\menus.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
shmnview.exe /shtml "f:\temp\menus.html" /sort "Menu Name" /sort
"Extensions"
