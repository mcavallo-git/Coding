Description
===========

Shell Extensions are in-process COM objects which extend the abilities of
Windows operating system. Most shell extensions are automatically
installed by the operating system, but there are also many other
applications that install additional shell extension components. For
example: If you install WinZip on your computer, you'll see a special
WinZip menu when you right-click on a Zip file. This menu is created by
adding a shell extension to the system.

The ShellExView utility displays the details of shell extensions
installed on your computer, and allows you to easily disable and enable
each shell extension.

ShellExView can be used for solving context-menu problems in Explorer
environment. For more information, read the following article:
Right-click is slow or weird behavior caused by context menu handlers



System Requirements

and up to Windows 10. x64 versions of Windows are also supported.

  ShellExView with /wow64 command-line option.
* Added /remote command-line option, which allows you to
  view/enable/disable shell extensions in a remote computer on your
  network.


29/08/2009
1.41

* Changed the definition of 'Suspicious Shell Extensions' - In previous
  versions, Every shell extension with read-only attribute marked as
  Suspicious, which confused some users, because there are many
  legitimated shell extensions that set a read-only attribute, probably
  to protect them from delete by the user. However, if a shell extension
  has an hidden attribute, it'll still be marked as suspicious.


22/08/2009
1.40

* Added option to submit a report about a shell extension that you
  disabled to http://shellfix.nirsoft.net.

24/10/2008
1.25

* New restriction: ShellExView won't allow you to disable at once more
  than 15 shell extensions created by Microsoft. The reason for this
  restriction is that recently there were a few cases of people that
  disabled most of their shell extensions, including system extensions
  that installed as a part of the operating system, and then found
  themselves with a system that cannot boot properly.


02/10/2008

Disable/Enable Shell Extensions
===============================

The ShellExView utility allows you to disable and enable the shell
extensions components on your system. In order to disable or enable a
shell extension item, select the desired item, and from the File menu (or
from the pop-up menu) select the appropriate option - "Enable Selected
Items" or "Disable Selected Items".
Here's 2 examples of useful things that you can do with this feature:

* Context Menu: Some applications, like WinZip, CuteFTP, and others,
  add some items to the context menu when you right-click on a file in
  explorer window. If you disable the appropriate shell extension, you
  won't get these additional menu items.
  In order to locate the desired shell extension item:
  1. Sort the extensions list by the "Type" column and look at all
     "Context Menu" items.
  2. Search the application that creates the menu you want to
     disable. The icon near each item can help to locate the desired
     shell extension.

* Shell Folder: When you enter into some special folders like "History"
  and "Temporary Internet Files", you don't see the real file system, but
  the a virtual folder that the shell extension create for you. If you
  want to watch the real file system inside "History" or "Temporary
  Internet Files", you can disable the appropriate shell extension items.



Sending report to shellfix.nirsoft.net
======================================

If you solved a problem by disabling a shell extension in your Explorer,
and you want to share it with others, you can use the 'Send Report To
ShellFix' option to publish the information in
http://shellfix.nirsoft.net. You can find full instructions about how to
send a report in the main page of http://shellfix.nirsoft.net Web site.



Add/Remove special folders to "My Computer" and "Desktop" folders
=================================================================

Some special shell folders like "Printers", "Recycle Bin", "Scheduled
Tasks", "Network and Dial-up Connections", "Mobile Device", and others
can be added (and be removed) to "My Computer", "Desktop", and even to
"Control Panel" (Only in Windows 2000) by using the ShellExView utility.
For Example: Under Windows 2000, you can add the "Printers", "Recycle
Bin", and "Scheduled Tasks" folders to "My Computer". In order to do
that, select the item that you want to add or remove (You can only use
"Shell Folder" items) and from the File menu, select the appropriate
add/remove option.
Be aware that there are some shell folders that cannot be added to "My
Computer" or "Desktop" folders. For example: adding the "Administrative
Tools" folder to "My Computer" won't work properly as you might expect.



Mark Suspicious Shell Extensions
================================

Most shell extensions use standard file extensions (.dll, .ocx or .cpl)
as well as they usually don't turn on their system attribues
(read-only/hidden/system). If ShellExView detect shell extension with
unusual file extension or with unusual attribute (e.g: shell extension
dll that is marked as hidden in the file system), it'll be marked in red
color. It's recommended to deeply check these unusual shell extensions to
insure that they are not unwanted malicious programs that penetrated into
your system.



Command-line options
====================



/stext <Filename>
Save the list of shell extensions into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the list of shell extensions into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the list of shell extensions into a comma-delimited text file.

/stabular <Filename>

/shtml <Filename>

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the list of shell extensions into vertical HTML file.

/sxml <Filename>

columns size, etc. )

/wow64
On x64 systems, load ShellExView for using with 32-bit applications.

/external <Windows Directory> <User Profile Folder (Optional)>
Run ShellExView on external instance of Windows operating system. This
option can be useful when you have Windows operating system that cannot
boot properly. The <User Profile Folder> parameter is optional. If you
don't specify it, ShellExView won't load extensions lists that are stored
in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

Example:
shexview.exe /external "k:\windows" "k:\Documents and
Settings\Administrator"

/remote < \\ComputerName >
Use ShellExView with the shell extensions of a remote computer on your
network. You must have full administrator access on the remote computer
in order to use this feature.

If you fail to connect the remote computer with ShellExView, read the
instructions in the following Blog post:
How to connect a remote Windows 7/Vista/XP computer with NirSoft
utilities.

/disable <CLSID>
Disables the specified shell extension. You should specify the exact
CLSID value that you see in the CLSID column, for example:
shexview.exe /disable {120B94B5-2E6A-4F13-94D0-414BCB64FA0F}

/enable <CLSID>
Enables the specified shell extension. You should specify the exact CLSID
value that you see in the CLSID column, for example:
shexview.exe /enable {120B94B5-2E6A-4F13-94D0-414BCB64FA0F}



Translating ShellExView to other languages
==========================================

In order to translate ShellExView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run ShellExView with /savelangfile parameter:
   shexview.exe /savelangfile
   A file named shexview_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   ShellExView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run ShellExView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run ShellExView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
